``````

### How Lattice Built Benefits Around Company Values
Lattice has designed its benefits package to reflect its core values, emphasizing the integration of company culture into employee benefits. Maurice Bell, Lattice's Head of People Operations, highlights that benefits should feel intentional and authentic to an organization's culture. Lattice’s four core values—Ship, Shipmate, Self, Chop Wood, Carry Water, Clear Eyes, and What's Next—guide their benefits decisions, ensuring each offering aligns with these principles.

The company uses annual employee feedback surveys to monitor and adjust its benefits package. A notable revision based on employee requests was the introduction of a 401(k) matching program, underscoring the company's commitment to long-term financial wellness for its employees. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lattice updated its wellness bundle and emergency fund to offer more comprehensive support for employees affected by the crisis.

### What Employee Total Rewards Implement
A total rewards package combines both monetary and non-monetary compensation to provide a holistic value proposition to employees. Key components include traditional financial rewards like salaries and bonuses, as well as additional benefits such as health insurance, retirement plans, and professional development programs.

Calculating and communicating the total rewards to employees can aid in attracting and retaining top talent, fostering loyalty, and enhancing engagement. Frequent employee surveys ensure that benefits remain relevant and valuable, and transparent communication about these benefits helps employees appreciate their full compensation package.

### RFH Insight: Reinvent Benefits Package - Lattice
Facing the challenge of evolving employee expectations, Lattice's RFH community discussed modern strategies for overhauling benefits packages. Key recommendations include conducting research to tailor benefits to the needs of specific employee demographics and gathering feedback through surveys to ensure offerings are impactful and appreciated.

Effectively communicating benefits is crucial, with proposed methods ranging from employee Slack channels to town hall meetings. Transparency about the process and decisions underlying benefits packages helps build trust and encourage utilization.

### HR's Guide to Employee Assistance Programs - Lattice
Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) provide essential support for employees dealing with a variety of personal and workplace issues including mental health, conflicts, childcare, elder care, and legal guidance. Lattice’s insights stress the importance of choosing a high-quality, standalone EAP model to ensure comprehensive support.

Promoting the confidentiality and accessibility of EAP services, especially through remote counseling options like teletherapy, is vital for encouraging employee participation. Regular reminders and top-down endorsement from management can increase awareness and utilization of EAPs.

### Show Benefits in Total Compensation - Lattice Help Center
Lattice’s total compensation view is planned to include benefits, underscoring the importance of making these visible to employees. This transparency helps employees understand the complete value of their rewards package, thereby recognizing the integral role of benefits in their overall compensation.

### What Continuous Feedback Benefits? - Lattice
Continuous feedback systems complement traditional performance reviews by providing regular and actionable insights to employees. This approach helps drive growth, improve employee engagement, and strengthen workplace relationships. Weekly one-on-ones and real-time feedback play crucial roles in this strategy.

### How HR Teams Support Working Parents - Lattice
Lattice emphasizes the need for supporting working parents through flexible work arrangements, paid parental leave, and inclusive benefits. Offering and communicating these benefits effectively can improve employee satisfaction, retention, and inclusion.

### Building Fair and Equitable Employee Compensation at GoodUnited
Lattice helped GoodUnited streamline its people processes, ensuring fair and transparent compensation reviews. Integrating performance data with compensation decisions allowed for more consistent and reliable pay adjustments. The use of Lattice’s platform for engagement surveys, career growth, and performance management provided valuable insights, facilitating strategic HR decisions and improving overall employee satisfaction and growth opportunities.

With organizations eager to attract and retain employees amidst a landscape of high turnover and evolving work environments, Lattice has devised a benefits package that reflects its commitment to its employees' well-being and aligns with its core values.

Key takeaways from the article include:

1. **Core Values Integration**: Lattice’s benefits are deeply rooted in its four core values — "Ship, Shipmate, Self," "Chop Wood, Carry Water," "Clear Eyes," and "What’s Next." These values serve as a framework for decision-making and are integral to the company’s approach to benefits.

2. **Intentional Benefits**: Rather than adopting a scattergun approach to benefits, Lattice focuses on authenticity and intentionality, ensuring that each benefit resonates with and reflects the company’s values. Maurice Bell, head of People Operations, emphasized the need to create benefits that feel genuine to employees.

3. **Employee Feedback**: Lattice conducts annual employee feedback surveys to continuously evaluate and refine its benefits. This ensures that the benefits remain relevant and valuable to employees.

4. **COVID-19 Adjustments**: In response to the pandemic, Lattice expanded its wellness offerings to include mental health support, virtual healthcare, behavioral coaching, and an emergency fund for COVID-19 positive individuals.

5. **Financial Wellness Programs**: Recognizing the demand for financial security among employees, Lattice introduced a 401(k) matching program and access to a financial wellness platform that provides personalized financial planning support.

6. **Holistic Well-being**: Benefits at Lattice also cater to physical health, with stipends for health and fitness, mental well-being support, and comprehensive parental leave policies that underscore the company’s understanding of the importance of work-life balance.

7. **Transparent Communication**: Transparency is a key aspect of Lattice’s benefits strategy. The company is open about the financial and operational rationales behind its benefits, fostering trust and understanding among employees.

8. **Future Focused**: Lattice’s benefits strategy is forward-looking, aiming to meet the evolving needs of a growing and diverse employee base. This includes offering specialized benefits like fertility insurance and sabbatical programs.

Lattice’s approach demonstrates how a company can effectively use its core values to shape a benefits package that not only attracts and retains talent but also promotes a supportive and engaged work culture.```json

**How Lattice Built Employee Benefits Around Company Values**

Lattice, a company dedicated to employee success, understands that effective employee benefits are not just about competitive compensation. They need to reflect the company's core values to truly resonate with employees. Lattice identified four core values that drive their benefits offerings: "ship, shipmate, self," "chop wood, carry water," "clear eyes," and "what's next."

**Ship, Shipmate, Self** highlights a team-first mentality, emphasizing collective growth and success. **Chop Wood, Carry Water** signals the importance of focusing on daily tasks to achieve long-term goals. **Clear Eyes** represents the company's commitment to pragmatism, transparency, and continuous improvement. **What's Next** embodies the relentless pursuit of learning and growth.

Lattice leverages annual employee feedback surveys to ensure their benefits are both relevant and valuable. For instance, employee requests led to the introduction of a 401(k) matching program, which was complemented by access to financial wellness platforms. This reflects the "clear eyes" value by maintaining transparency about the company's financial decisions related to employee benefits.

Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Lattice expanded their wellness bundle to include mental health support, virtual healthcare, and financial support for affected employees. These initiatives are aligned with the "ship, shipmate, self" value, emphasizing physical, mental, and emotional care for employees.

The company's approach to benefits is continuously evolving with its growth. In 2021, Lattice added 270 new employees and plans to onboard another 500 in 2022. They are keen on keeping their benefits aligned with their growing and diversifying workforce, making offerings such as a sabbatical program and fertility insurance available in response to employee feedback.

The key takeaway from Lattice’s strategy is the seamless integration of core values into their benefits package, ensuring they are intentional, genuine, and supportive of employee needs. They focus on transparency and continuous improvement, reinforcing the company's commitment to their employees' holistic well-being. This thoughtful approach not only helps in retaining current talent but also in attracting new ones aligned with the company's values.

This summary encompasses important information regarding Lattice's approach to employee benefits, showcasing their commitment to aligning benefits with company values and the needs of their employees.
