    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "You have 2 tasks to perform:\n\nTask 1:\nBased on what the EvaBot does and what the Lattice does write top 3 compelling insights that can help EvaBot SELL its product and services (not for integration, partnership or collaboration) to Lattice using the business news summaries of Lattice. The idea is to find either an immediate challenge faced by Lattice that EvaBot's product/solution can solve, or a strategic initiative where EvaBot's product/solution can easily fit, or a growth area where EvaBot's product/solution can have a direct impact. The output can follow this broad structure: 1. What is the challenge/strategic/growth initiative where the product/solution fits, 2. How do we know? (Quote/data/inference from the business news summaries) 3. How can the product/solution help.\nDo not mention partnership/collaboration angle in the pitch and DO NOT pick NEGATIVE news. The pitch should be highly relevant to EvaBot, and must be quoted from the business news summaries. Give \"no relevant insights found\" as output if you do not confidently say the insight is relevant/impactful. \n\nGood example because it's extremely relevant, positive, numbers are quoted and points towards an area of interest for Datadog: Supporting Datadog's Growth in the Generative AI Sector\nDemandbase can assist Datadog in capitalizing on its emerging generative AI customer base through targeted B2B Advertising and Sales Intelligence, aligning marketing efforts with the rapid growth in this sector. Datadog reported that approximately 2.5% of its annual recurring revenue came from generative AI companies. By using Demandbase's Account-Based Marketing and Sales Intelligence solutions, Datadog can further penetrate this growing sector, nurturing and expanding its customer base in an area that's already showing promise.\n\nGreat example because it is directly connects the strategic goal to the what the company offers:\nSupporting Goldman Sachs' Strategic Expansion in Private Credit\nJoveo's targeted recruitment advertising can assist Goldman Sachs in sourcing specialized talent for its growing private credit unit. With Goldman Sachs' ambitions to double the size of its private credit unit, there is an imminent need for specialized talent in this area. Joveo's AI-driven recruitment solutions can help Goldman Sachs target and attract candidates with the specific skill sets required for success in private financing solutions, supporting the firm's growth strategy in this sector.\n\nBad example because it picked up negative news: Demandbase One™ can optimize Confluent's sales and marketing alignment, ensuring that the company's efforts in these areas are informed by comprehensive data and AI insights, particularly important given the recent insider selling activity. The insider selling activity by Confluent's CEO may suggest a need for a more strategic approach to market positioning and sales. Demandbase One™ could provide the necessary alignment between sales and marketing, leveraging Account Intelligence to refine Confluent's go-to-market strategy and potentially mitigate investor concerns by demonstrating a proactive approach to market engagement.\n\nBad output example: EvaBot's advanced AI features can bolster Zip's AI initiatives, particularly Zip AI, by providing additional layers of sales intelligence and engagement throughout the customer lifecycle. The business news indicates that Zip has ventured into AI with Zip AI, aiming to automate workflows and provide insights. EvaBot's deep account and prospect research capabilities can enrich these workflows with more nuanced customer data. Zip's venture into AI and their focus on workflow automation aligns closely with EvaBot's AI-powered sales assistant capabilities, making this a strategic fit. The output is bad because here we are talking about improving someone else's product/solution. It's more like a partnership discussion not a sales discussion. ALWAYS avoid partnership insights.\n\nTask 2:\nEvaBot has to reach out to Lattice to SELL its product and services (not partnership or collaboration) but it has thousand other companies to reach out to. So we need to prioritize based on a percentile score. You have to come up with a brief analysis and a percentile score (assuming 1000 other companies) for the analysis based on 1. Is there a mention of the topic \"['Acquistion', 'Fundraising', 'Virtual sales specialist']\" or topics that are semantically similar in the data provided (give most weightage to this if present)  2. Is there something really time-sensitive in the data provided 3. Is there a major event/change/challenge that is happening at Lattice and is directly relevant to the products/solutions offered by EvaBot (if the EvaBot sells many solutions or its ambiguous then use the data in the PITCH to find relevancy). SKIP the analysis, do it in your head.\nSCORING INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. If there is a breaking news in the data available for the buying company that is directly related to the solutions offered by the selling company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 2. If the KEYWORD or similar keywords provided is mentioned in the data for the buying company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 3. If you can infer that the selling companies pitch/product/solution directly relates to or solve for some of recent news, development, challenges, then that's a high priority account with 80-90 percentile 4. If there is no keyword (similar keywords) match and none of the data indicate time sensitivity but the analysis is still relevant it's a medium priority account with 65-75 percentile, 5. If Lattice news contains very less or non informative data it's a very low priority with less than 50 percentile 6. If none of the criteria matches and the relevancy is weak too, it's a low priority account with 50-60 percentile.\nEXAMPLES:\n1. Score: 90. Analysis: XYZ company (Buying company) has explicitly mentioned growth challenges (keyword match) related to AI initiatives and sales cycles, which are directly relevant to selling company's solutions. The urgency is high due to the time-sensitive nature of overcoming sales hurdles and capitalizing on AI readiness. There is also a major strategic focus on enhancing cloud service sales where selling company's capabilities can have a direct impact.\n2. Score: 85. Analysis: ABC company (Buying company) explicitly mentions the need for AI-driven efficiencies and faces execution risks in sales, which are directly relevant to selling company's product offerings. The planned significant investment in Business AI and the ongoing restructuring highlight a time-sensitive opportunity for selling company. However, there's no explicit mention of a growth challenge (no keyword match), which slightly lowers the priority. Given these factors, SAP Concur is a high-priority account for selling company.\n3. Score: 70. Analysis: There is no explicit mention of growth challenges (no keyword match), time-sensitive issues, or major events in the business news summary of ABC company (buying company) that would directly correlate with Selling company's services. However, the strategic initiatives and distribution network optimization mentioned for buying company align well with selling company's sales intelligence and engagement capabilities. Given the positive alignment but lack of explicit high-priority triggers, the account is scored at the 70th percentile.\n4. Score: 50. Analysis: The business news summary for ABC company (buying company) does not mention growth challenges, time-sensitive issues, or major events that are directly relevant to selling company's products or solutions. There is no clear connection between buying company current situation, as described in the news summary, and the services offered by selling company. Therefore, buying company would be a lower priority compared to other companies that may have more immediate and relevant needs for selling company's services.\n\n\nGive the output in JSON format:\n        JSON Structure: {\n            \"insights\":[\n                {\n                    \"headline\": <str>,\n                    \"insight\": <str>,\n                    \"score\": <integer>,\n                    \"justification\": <str>\n                }\n            ],\n            \"accountScore\":{\n                \"score\": <integer>,\n                \"analysis\": <str>\n            }\n        }\n    "

      "role": "user",
      "content": "You have 2 tasks to perform:\n\nTask 1:\nBased on what the EvaBot does and what the Lattice does write top 3 compelling insights that can help EvaBot SELL its product and services (not for integration, partnership or collaboration) to Lattice using the business news summaries of Lattice. The idea is to find either an immediate challenge faced by Lattice that EvaBot's product/solution can solve, or a strategic initiative where EvaBot's product/solution can easily fit, or a growth area where EvaBot's product/solution can have a direct impact. The output can follow this broad structure: 1. What is the challenge/strategic/growth initiative where the product/solution fits, 2. How do we know? (Quote/data/inference from the business news summaries) 3. How can the product/solution help.\nDo not mention partnership/collaboration angle in the pitch and DO NOT pick NEGATIVE news. The pitch should be highly relevant to EvaBot, and must be quoted from the business news summaries. Give \"no relevant insights found\" as output if you do not confidently say the insight is relevant/impactful. \n\nGood example because it's extremely relevant, positive, numbers are quoted and points towards an area of interest for Datadog: Supporting Datadog's Growth in the Generative AI Sector\nDemandbase can assist Datadog in capitalizing on its emerging generative AI customer base through targeted B2B Advertising and Sales Intelligence, aligning marketing efforts with the rapid growth in this sector. Datadog reported that approximately 2.5% of its annual recurring revenue came from generative AI companies. By using Demandbase's Account-Based Marketing and Sales Intelligence solutions, Datadog can further penetrate this growing sector, nurturing and expanding its customer base in an area that's already showing promise.\n\nGreat example because it is directly connects the strategic goal to the what the company offers:\nSupporting Goldman Sachs' Strategic Expansion in Private Credit\nJoveo's targeted recruitment advertising can assist Goldman Sachs in sourcing specialized talent for its growing private credit unit. With Goldman Sachs' ambitions to double the size of its private credit unit, there is an imminent need for specialized talent in this area. Joveo's AI-driven recruitment solutions can help Goldman Sachs target and attract candidates with the specific skill sets required for success in private financing solutions, supporting the firm's growth strategy in this sector.\n\nBad example because it picked up negative news: Demandbase One™ can optimize Confluent's sales and marketing alignment, ensuring that the company's efforts in these areas are informed by comprehensive data and AI insights, particularly important given the recent insider selling activity. The insider selling activity by Confluent's CEO may suggest a need for a more strategic approach to market positioning and sales. Demandbase One™ could provide the necessary alignment between sales and marketing, leveraging Account Intelligence to refine Confluent's go-to-market strategy and potentially mitigate investor concerns by demonstrating a proactive approach to market engagement.\n\nBad output example: EvaBot's advanced AI features can bolster Zip's AI initiatives, particularly Zip AI, by providing additional layers of sales intelligence and engagement throughout the customer lifecycle. The business news indicates that Zip has ventured into AI with Zip AI, aiming to automate workflows and provide insights. EvaBot's deep account and prospect research capabilities can enrich these workflows with more nuanced customer data. Zip's venture into AI and their focus on workflow automation aligns closely with EvaBot's AI-powered sales assistant capabilities, making this a strategic fit. The output is bad because here we are talking about improving someone else's product/solution. It's more like a partnership discussion not a sales discussion. ALWAYS avoid partnership insights.\n\nTask 2:\nEvaBot has to reach out to Lattice to SELL its product and services (not partnership or collaboration) but it has thousand other companies to reach out to. So we need to prioritize based on a percentile score. You have to come up with a brief analysis and a percentile score (assuming 1000 other companies) for the analysis based on 1. Is there a mention of the topic \"['Acquistion', 'Fundraising', 'Virtual sales specialist']\" or topics that are semantically similar in the data provided (give most weightage to this if present)  2. Is there something really time-sensitive in the data provided 3. Is there a major event/change/challenge that is happening at Lattice and is directly relevant to the products/solutions offered by EvaBot (if the EvaBot sells many solutions or its ambiguous then use the data in the PITCH to find relevancy). SKIP the analysis, do it in your head.\nSCORING INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. If there is a breaking news in the data available for the buying company that is directly related to the solutions offered by the selling company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 2. If the KEYWORD or similar keywords provided is mentioned in the data for the buying company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 3. If you can infer that the selling companies pitch/product/solution directly relates to or solve for some of recent news, development, challenges, then that's a high priority account with 80-90 percentile 4. If there is no keyword (similar keywords) match and none of the data indicate time sensitivity but the analysis is still relevant it's a medium priority account with 65-75 percentile, 5. If Lattice news contains very less or non informative data it's a very low priority with less than 50 percentile 6. If none of the criteria matches and the relevancy is weak too, it's a low priority account with 50-60 percentile.\nEXAMPLES:\n1. Score: 90. Analysis: XYZ company (Buying company) has explicitly mentioned growth challenges (keyword match) related to AI initiatives and sales cycles, which are directly relevant to selling company's solutions. The urgency is high due to the time-sensitive nature of overcoming sales hurdles and capitalizing on AI readiness. There is also a major strategic focus on enhancing cloud service sales where selling company's capabilities can have a direct impact.\n2. Score: 85. Analysis: ABC company (Buying company) explicitly mentions the need for AI-driven efficiencies and faces execution risks in sales, which are directly relevant to selling company's product offerings. The planned significant investment in Business AI and the ongoing restructuring highlight a time-sensitive opportunity for selling company. However, there's no explicit mention of a growth challenge (no keyword match), which slightly lowers the priority. Given these factors, SAP Concur is a high-priority account for selling company.\n3. Score: 70. Analysis: There is no explicit mention of growth challenges (no keyword match), time-sensitive issues, or major events in the business news summary of ABC company (buying company) that would directly correlate with Selling company's services. However, the strategic initiatives and distribution network optimization mentioned for buying company align well with selling company's sales intelligence and engagement capabilities. Given the positive alignment but lack of explicit high-priority triggers, the account is scored at the 70th percentile.\n4. Score: 50. Analysis: The business news summary for ABC company (buying company) does not mention growth challenges, time-sensitive issues, or major events that are directly relevant to selling company's products or solutions. There is no clear connection between buying company current situation, as described in the news summary, and the services offered by selling company. Therefore, buying company would be a lower priority compared to other companies that may have more immediate and relevant needs for selling company's services.\n\n\nGive the output in JSON format:\n        JSON Structure: {\n            \"insights\":[\n                {\n                    \"headline\": <str>,\n                    \"insight\": <str>,\n                    \"score\": <integer>,\n                    \"justification\": <str>\n                }\n            ],\n            \"accountScore\":{\n                \"score\": <integer>,\n                \"analysis\": <str>\n            }\n        }\n    "

Demandbase One™ could provide the necessary alignment between sales and marketing, leveraging Account Intelligence to refine Confluent's go-to-market strategy and potentially mitigate investor concerns by demonstrating a proactive approach to market engagement.\n\nBad output example: EvaBot's advanced AI features can bolster Zip's AI initiatives, particularly Zip AI, by providing additional layers of sales intelligence and engagement throughout the customer lifecycle. The business news indicates that Zip has ventured into AI with Zip AI, aiming to automate workflows and provide insights. EvaBot's deep account and prospect research capabilities can enrich these workflows with more nuanced customer data. Zip's venture into AI and their focus on workflow automation aligns closely with EvaBot's AI-powered sales assistant capabilities, making this a strategic fit.

ALWAYS avoid partnership insights.\n\nTask 2:\nEvaBot has to reach out to Lattice to SELL its product and services (not partnership or collaboration) but it has thousand other companies to reach out to. So we need to prioritize based on a percentile score. You have to come up with a brief analysis and a percentile score (assuming 1000 other companies) for the analysis based on 1. Is there a mention of the topic \"['Operational efficiency', 'Tool consolidation']\" or topics that are semantically similar in the data provided (give most weightage to this if present)  2. Is there something really time-sensitive in the data provided 3. Is there a major event/change/challenge that is happening at Lattice and is directly relevant to the products/solutions offered by EvaBot (if the EvaBot sells many solutions or its ambiguous then use the data in the PITCH to find relevancy). SKIP the analysis, do it in your head.\nSCORING INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. If there is a breaking news in the data available for the buying company that is directly related to the solutions offered by the selling company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 2. If the KEYWORD or similar keywords provided is mentioned in the data for the buying company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 3. If you can infer that the selling companies pitch/product/solution directly relates to or solve for some of recent news, development, challenges, then that's a high priority account with 80-90 percentile 4. If there is no keyword (similar keywords) match and none of the data indicate time sensitivity but the analysis is still relevant it's a medium priority account with 65-75 percentile, 5. If Lattice news contains very less or non informative data it's a very low priority with less than 50 percentile 6. If none of the criteria matches and the relevancy is weak too, it's a low priority account with 50-60 percentile.\nEXAMPLES:\n1. Score: 90. Analysis: XYZ company (Buying company) has explicitly mentioned growth challenges (keyword match) related to AI initiatives and sales cycles, which are directly relevant to selling company's solutions. The urgency is high due to the time-sensitive nature of overcoming sales hurdles and capitalizing on AI readiness. There is also a major strategic focus on enhancing cloud service sales where selling company's capabilities can have a direct impact.\n2. Score: 85. Analysis: ABC company (Buying company) explicitly mentions the need for AI-driven efficiencies and faces execution risks in sales, which are directly relevant to selling company's product offerings. The planned significant investment in Business AI and the ongoing restructuring highlight a time-sensitive opportunity for selling company.

However, the strategic initiatives and distribution network optimization mentioned for buying company align well with selling company's sales intelligence and engagement capabilities. Given the positive alignment but lack of explicit high-priority triggers, the account is scored at the 70th percentile.\n4. Score: 50. Analysis: The business news summary for ABC company (buying company) does not mention growth challenges, time-sensitive issues, or major events that are directly relevant to selling company's products or solutions. There is no clear connection between buying company current situation, as described in the news summary, and the services offered by selling company.

The idea is to find either an immediate challenge faced by Lattice that EvaBot's product/solution can solve, or a strategic initiative where EvaBot's product/solution can easily fit, or a growth area where EvaBot's product/solution can have a direct impact. The output can follow this broad structure: 1. What is the challenge/strategic/growth initiative where the product/solution fits, 2. How do we know? (Quote/data/inference from the business news summaries) 3. How can the product/solution help.\nDo not mention partnership/collaboration angle in the pitch and DO NOT pick NEGATIVE news. The pitch should be highly relevant to EvaBot, and must be quoted from the business news summaries.

The output can follow this broad structure: 1. What is the challenge/strategic/growth initiative where the product/solution fits, 2. How do we know? (Quote/data/inference from the business news summaries) 3. How can the product/solution help.\nDo not mention partnership/collaboration angle in the pitch and DO NOT pick NEGATIVE news. The pitch should be highly relevant to EvaBot, and must be quoted from the business news summaries. Give \"no relevant insights found\" as output if you do not confidently say the insight is relevant/impactful. \n\nGood example because it's extremely relevant, positive, numbers are quoted and points towards an area of interest for Datadog: Supporting Datadog's Growth in the Generative AI Sector\nDemandbase can assist Datadog in capitalizing on its emerging generative AI customer base through targeted B2B Advertising and Sales Intelligence, aligning marketing efforts with the rapid growth in this sector. Datadog reported that approximately 2.5% of its annual recurring revenue came from generative AI companies. By using Demandbase's Account-Based Marketing and Sales Intelligence solutions, Datadog can further penetrate this growing sector, nurturing and expanding its customer base in an area that's already showing promise.\n\nGreat example because it is directly connects the strategic goal to the what the company offers:\nSupporting Goldman Sachs' Strategic Expansion in Private Credit\nJoveo's targeted recruitment advertising can assist Goldman Sachs in sourcing specialized talent for its growing private credit unit. With Goldman Sachs' ambitions to double the size of its private credit unit, there is an imminent need for specialized talent in this area. Joveo's AI-driven recruitment solutions can help Goldman Sachs target and attract candidates with the specific skill sets required for success in private financing solutions, supporting the firm's growth strategy in this sector.\n\nBad example because it picked up negative news: Demandbase One™ can optimize Confluent's sales and marketing alignment, ensuring that the company's efforts in these areas are informed by comprehensive data and AI insights, particularly important given the recent insider selling activity. The insider selling activity by Confluent's CEO may suggest a need for a more strategic approach to market positioning and sales. Demandbase One™ could provide the necessary alignment between sales and marketing, leveraging Account Intelligence to refine Confluent's go-to-market strategy and potentially mitigate investor concerns by demonstrating a proactive approach to market engagement.\n\nBad output example: EvaBot's advanced AI features can bolster Zip's AI initiatives, particularly Zip AI, by providing additional layers of sales intelligence and engagement throughout the customer lifecycle. The business news indicates that Zip has ventured into AI with Zip AI, aiming to automate workflows and provide insights. EvaBot's deep account and prospect research capabilities can enrich these workflows with more nuanced customer data. Zip's venture into AI and their focus on workflow automation aligns closely with EvaBot's AI-powered sales assistant capabilities, making this a strategic fit. The output is bad because here we are talking about improving someone else's product/solution. It's more like a partnership discussion not a sales discussion. ALWAYS avoid partnership insights.\n\nTask 2:\nEvaBot has to reach out to Motus to SELL its product and services (not partnership or collaboration) but it has thousand other companies to reach out to. So we need to prioritize based on a percentile score. You have to come up with a brief analysis and a percentile score (assuming 1000 other companies) for the analysis based on 1. Is there a mention of the topic \"['hiring Virtual sales specialist', 'hiring SDR LEADERS', 'hiring Test1', 'Acquistion', 'Fundraising', 'Test', 'Test2', 'Test3', 'Test4', 'Test5', 'Growth', 'Sales', 'fact Employee Benefits', 'fact Employee Growth']\" or topics that are semantically similar in the data provided (give most weightage to this if present)  2. Is there something really time-sensitive in the data provided 3. Is there a major event/change/challenge that is happening at Motus and is directly relevant to the products/solutions offered by EvaBot (if the EvaBot sells many solutions or its ambiguous then use the data in the PITCH to find relevancy). SKIP the analysis, do it in your head.\nSCORING INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. If there is a breaking news in the data available for the buying company that is directly related to the solutions offered by the selling company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 2. If the KEYWORD or similar keywords provided is mentioned in the data for the buying company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 3. If you can infer that the selling companies pitch/product/solution directly relates to or solve for some of recent news, development, challenges, then that's a high priority account with 80-90 percentile 4. If there is no keyword (similar keywords) match and none of the data indicate time sensitivity but the analysis is still relevant it's a medium priority account with 65-75 percentile, 5. If Motus news contains very less or non informative data it's a very low priority with less than 50 percentile 6. If none of the criteria matches and the relevancy is weak too, it's a low priority account with 50-60 percentile.\nEXAMPLES:\n1. Score: 90. Analysis: XYZ company (Buying company) has explicitly mentioned growth challenges (keyword match) related to AI initiatives and sales cycles, which are directly relevant to selling company's solutions. The urgency is high due to the time-sensitive nature of overcoming sales hurdles and capitalizing on AI readiness. There is also a major strategic focus on enhancing cloud service sales where selling company's capabilities can have a direct impact.\n2. Score: 85. Analysis: ABC company (Buying company) explicitly mentions the need for AI-driven efficiencies and faces execution risks in sales, which are directly relevant to selling company's product offerings. The planned significant investment in Business AI and the ongoing restructuring highlight a time-sensitive opportunity for selling company. However, there's no explicit mention of a growth challenge (no keyword match), which slightly lowers the priority. Given these factors, SAP Concur is a high-priority account for selling company.\n3. Score: 70. Analysis: There is no explicit mention of growth challenges (no keyword match), time-sensitive issues, or major events in the business news summary of ABC company (buying company) that would directly correlate with Selling company's services. However, the strategic initiatives and distribution network optimization mentioned for buying company align well with selling company's sales intelligence and engagement capabilities. Given the positive alignment but lack of explicit high-priority triggers, the account is scored at the 70th percentile.\n4. Score: 50. Analysis: The business news summary for ABC company (buying company) does not mention growth challenges, time-sensitive issues, or major events that are directly relevant to selling company's products or solutions. There is no clear connection between buying company current situation, as described in the news summary, and the services offered by selling company. Therefore, buying company would be a lower priority compared to other companies that may have more immediate and relevant needs for selling company's services.\n\n\nGive the output in JSON format:\n        JSON Structure: {\n            \"insights\":[\n                {\n                    \"headline\": <str>,\n                    \"insight\": <str>,\n                    \"score\": <integer>,\n                    \"justification\": <str>\n                }\n            ],\n            \"accountScore\":{\n                \"score\": <integer>,\n                \"analysis\": <str>\n            }\n        }\n    "

Demandbase One™ could provide the necessary alignment between sales and marketing, leveraging Account Intelligence to refine Confluent's go-to-market strategy and potentially mitigate investor concerns by demonstrating a proactive approach to market engagement.\n\nBad output example: EvaBot's advanced AI features can bolster Zip's AI initiatives, particularly Zip AI, by providing additional layers of sales intelligence and engagement throughout the customer lifecycle. The business news indicates that Zip has ventured into AI with Zip AI, aiming to automate workflows and provide insights. EvaBot's deep account and prospect research capabilities can enrich these workflows with more nuanced customer data. Zip's venture into AI and their focus on workflow automation aligns closely with EvaBot's AI-powered sales assistant capabilities, making this a strategic fit. The output is bad because here we are talking about improving someone else's product/solution. It's more like a partnership discussion not a sales discussion. ALWAYS avoid partnership insights.\n\nTask 2:\nEvaBot has to reach out to Motus to SELL its product and services (not partnership or collaboration) but it has thousand other companies to reach out to. So we need to prioritize based on a percentile score. You have to come up with a brief analysis and a percentile score (assuming 1000 other companies) for the analysis based on 1. Is there a mention of the topic \"['hiring Virtual sales specialist', 'hiring SDR LEADERS', 'hiring Test1', 'Acquistion', 'Fundraising', 'Test', 'Test2', 'Test3', 'Test4', 'Test5', 'Growth', 'Sales', 'fact Employee Benefits', 'fact Employee Growth']\" or topics that are semantically similar in the data provided (give most weightage to this if present)  2. Is there something really time-sensitive in the data provided 3. Is there a major event/change/challenge that is happening at Motus and is directly relevant to the products/solutions offered by EvaBot (if the EvaBot sells many solutions or its ambiguous then use the data in the PITCH to find relevancy). SKIP the analysis, do it in your head.\nSCORING INSTRUCTIONS:\n1. If there is a breaking news in the data available for the buying company that is directly related to the solutions offered by the selling company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 2. If the KEYWORD or similar keywords provided is mentioned in the data for the buying company, then that's an extremely high priority account with 90-100 percentile, 3. If you can infer that the selling companies pitch/product/solution directly relates to or solve for some of recent news, development, challenges, then that's a high priority account with 80-90 percentile 4. If there is no keyword (similar keywords) match and none of the data indicate time sensitivity but the analysis is still relevant it's a medium priority account with 65-75 percentile, 5. If Motus news contains very less or non informative data it's a very low priority with less than 50 percentile 6. If none of the criteria matches and the relevancy is weak too, it's a low priority account with 50-60 percentile.\nEXAMPLES:\n1. Score: 90. Analysis: XYZ company (Buying company) has explicitly mentioned growth challenges (keyword match) related to AI initiatives and sales cycles, which are directly relevant to selling company's solutions. The urgency is high due to the time-sensitive nature of overcoming sales hurdles and capitalizing on AI readiness. There is also a major strategic focus on enhancing cloud service sales where selling company's capabilities can have a direct impact.\n2. Score: 85. Analysis: ABC company (Buying company) explicitly mentions the need for AI-driven efficiencies and faces execution risks in sales, which are directly relevant to selling company's product offerings. The planned significant investment in Business AI and the ongoing restructuring highlight a time-sensitive opportunity for selling company. However, there's no explicit mention of a growth challenge (no keyword match), which slightly lowers the priority. Given these factors, SAP Concur is a high-priority account for selling company.\n3. Score: 70. Analysis: There is no explicit mention of growth challenges (no keyword match), time-sensitive issues, or major events in the business news summary of ABC company (buying company) that would directly correlate with Selling company's services. However, the strategic initiatives and distribution network optimization mentioned for buying company align well with selling company's sales intelligence and engagement capabilities. Given the positive alignment but lack of explicit high-priority triggers, the account is scored at the 70th percentile.\n4. Score: 50. Analysis: The business news summary for ABC company (buying company) does not mention growth challenges, time-sensitive issues, or major events that are directly relevant to selling company's products or solutions. There is no clear connection between buying company current situation, as described in the news summary, and the services offered by selling company. Therefore, buying company would be a lower priority compared to other companies that may have more immediate and relevant needs for selling company's services.\n\n\nGive the output in JSON format:\n        JSON Structure: {\n            \"insights\":[\n                {\n                    \"headline\": <str>,\n                    \"insight\": <str>,\n                    \"score\": <integer>,\n                    \"justification\": <str>\n                }\n            ],\n            \"accountScore\":{\n                \"score\": <integer>,\n                \"analysis\": <str>\n            }\n        }\n    "

We identified all the possible blockers that typically hinder response rates. The top 3 are:\\n\\n→ Certain keywords automatically direct emails to junk. For example, words like \"free,\" \"guarantee,\" or \"limited time offer\" can trigger personal spam filters.\\n\\n→ Pattern recognition in emails: Buyers have set personal filters for emails starting with \"Hi [FirstName], I hope this email finds you well,\" so these emails automatically go to junk.\\n\\n→ We updated our LinkedIn Page name from \"Evabot\" to \"Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0.\" As a result, we began receiving emails addressed to \"Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0.\" \\n\\nTo avoid spam, we created a filter that sends all emails containing the keyword \"Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0\" directly to the junk folder.\\n\\nHere are the steps we followed internally to achieve a 2x increase in response rates:\\n\\nStep 1. We created a list of words that were common across most emails.\\n\\nStep 2. We conducted account research on our target audience to gather relevant insights. This wasn\\'t just about job changes, acquisitions, or funding congratulations.\\n\\nStep 3. We identified the top insights out of dozens that were highly relevant to the pain points we could solve.\\n\\nStep 4. We prioritized accounts for outreach where the problem was most severe and recent.\\n\\nStep 5. We used email frameworks like OPPS and PSA.\\nAnd 5 more steps.\\n\\nWe detailed our process in our latest newsletter, “Email Prospecting - What Works and What Doesn\\'t.” Link in the comments.\\n\\nCheck it out.\\n\\nWe\\'ve also included a bonus prompt for you.', \"Account planning used to take a minimum of 8 hours/account. \\n\\nNow, it's reduced to just 30 minutes. How? 🤯 \\n\\nThe answer is #AI\\n\\nEarlier, sales reps had to manually research, enter data, and update account plans periodically.\\n\\nNow, AI can handle all the manual steps of the account planning process including a superhuman ability -- 24x7 monitoring and prioritizing thousands of accounts!\\n\\nLet's look at some of these abilities in detail: \\n\\n- AI continuously monitors accounts and highlights those where expansion is more likely (using account prioritization techniques).\\n\\n- AI automates the gathering and synthesis of basic account information like public/private, annual revenue, year started, customer’s vision/strategy, target markets, and financial information.\\n\\n- AI collects data from multiple sources like 10K reports, earnings calls, social media, and news articles, then consolidates it into actionable intelligence.\\n\\n- AI automatically generates and updates outreach communications based on frameworks and real-time insights. It provides time savings like no other technology before.\\n\\n- Current Process without AI: ~850 hours for 100 accounts\\n\\n- New Process with AI: ~50 hours for 100 accounts\\n\\nWe've written more about this in our latest newsletter, “Account Planning using AI in 30 Minutes.” Link in the comments below 👇 \", 'Getting less than a 0.7% \"Reply\" rate, even after adding personalization to your outreach? You need to check your messages and emails again.\\n\\nPersonalization is not an endpoint; it\\'s a spectrum that ranges from \"generic\" to \"specific.\"\\n\\nOpen your inbox, and you\\'ll find that 99% of so called personalized emails use the same generic messaging:\\n\\n- Job change information\\n- Funding news\\n- Looked at your website\\n- Saw you liked a post etc\\n- Saw you are hiring\\n\\nJust open your \"Sent\" folder and most likely the emails sent by your team will likely look similar. Correct?\\n\\nYou will realize that:\\n\\n1. You are not talking about the “deep” and “relevant” pain your prospect might be facing “right now”.\\n\\n2. Your team have missed out on trying to build a relationship, a connection. Even when it was very obvious (for example both the prospect and your sales rep play soccer and have kids)\\n\\n3. You are not coming across as someone who wants to “help” but as someone who wants to “sell”.\\n\\n4. Even when your reps are talking about the problem, they aren’t efficiently tying it back to the solution (especially when you sell many products or complicated solutions)\\n\\nThis is the difference between \"generic\" and \"specific\" personalization.\\n\\nAgree and want to learn more?\\n\\nWe have written more about this in our latest newsletter, \"Your Personalization Workflows: Analyze and Improve.\" Link in the comments below 👇', \"We love Nooks (Power Dialer) but…\\n\\n…even after using it for 5 months we were not satisfied with the results.\\n\\nSatwick had visualized the full potential of it but we were not seeing its impact in the real world.\\n\\nChallenges?\\n\\n1. Total number of dials an SDR can make depends on his/her confidence level for each prospect — more research/insights available more confidence, less research and they are terrified to call.\\n\\n2. Call to conversation ratio — It’s hard to control the connect rate (though you should fully leverage reporting available from Nooks to maximize this) but once the call is connected, improving the conversation rate is totally in the reps hands. Once again research and “pain based insights” really help here.\\n\\nAs we had been building Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0 we thought of solving these two challenges for our team.\\n\\nResults?\\n\\nMeetings doubled with the same number of sales reps 🤯 (see the screenshot below).\\n\\nHow?\\n\\n1. Since Eva AI can pre-generate deep research and insights for thousands of prospects (which then get synced with Outreach), our reps could theoretically dial unlimited prospects a day.\\n\\n2. Since the insights also talk about the real pain a prospect and their company is facing (which are directly tied to the solution we are selling), our call to conversation ratio also dramatically improved 😎 (screenshot showing total conversations on a monthly basis more than doubled for a sales rep).\\n\\nCombining the above two our reps are now hitting 2X their meeting goals using Nooks.\\n\\nAnd…\\n\\nThere is no limit (except for the hours of the day when they can dial) and we are targeting hitting 3X of our goals.\\n\\nLet me finish this with a really cool example:\\n\\n🤙Our rep Anish Saha calls the CRO of a public company.\\n\\nThe CRO says he is going into a board meeting but what is it about?\\n\\nAnish says — you have grown 35% last year and you are focusing on expanding further into 240 accounts that are worth a million dollars and you are looking at more sales tools this year, does that sound right?\\n\\nAt this point the CRO says think that this is some shareholder calling (because of the pointed question) 😇, stays on the call to learn more and helps Anish book a meeting with the right person 🔥 \\n\\nI'm happy to share how to set this up for your team and further brainstorm if interested. DM me or leave a comment :-)\", 'Everyone is saying \"Outbound is dead\"\\n\\nLet me rephrase -- \\n\"template based outbound... is dead\", \\n\"spray and pray... is dead\"\\n\"tactics based outbound... is dead\"\\n\\nSo what works?\\n\\nI will tell you...\\n\\nBut first... results! \\n\\nWe are booking 2X more meetings with the same number of sales reps in a world where \"outreach is supposed to be dead\" (check my last post).\\n\\nHow?\\n\\nDoing the fundamentals right 👇 \\n\\n✔ Deep research to find the \"pain\" a potential customer is facing that your product can solve for\\n\\n✔ Prioritizing those accounts where the pain is more acute and urgent\\n\\n✔ Finding commonalities, ice-breakers for the prospect\\n\\n✔ Using above 3 to lead with \"pain based personalization\" across cold calls, emails and LinkedIn messages\\n\\n✔ Following a rigorous cadence to do the above steps (with the help of AI of course)\\n\\nSo as you see outbound is not dead, mindless outbound is.

We identified all the possible blockers that typically hinder response rates. The top 3 are:\\n\\n→ Certain keywords automatically direct emails to junk. For example, words like \"free,\" \"guarantee,\" or \"limited time offer\" can trigger personal spam filters.\\n\\n→ Pattern recognition in emails: Buyers have set personal filters for emails starting with \"Hi [FirstName], I hope this email finds you well,\" so these emails automatically go to junk.\\n\\n→ We updated our LinkedIn Page name from \"Evabot\" to \"Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0.\" As a result, we began receiving emails addressed to \"Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0.\" \\n\\nTo avoid spam, we created a filter that sends all emails containing the keyword \"Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0\" directly to the junk folder.\\n\\nHere are the steps we followed internally to achieve a 2x increase in response rates:\\n\\nStep 1. We created a list of words that were common across most emails.\\n\\nStep 2. We conducted account research on our target audience to gather relevant insights. This wasn\\'t just about job changes, acquisitions, or funding congratulations.\\n\\nStep 3. We identified the top insights out of dozens that were highly relevant to the pain points we could solve.\\n\\nStep 4. We prioritized accounts for outreach where the problem was most severe and recent.\\n\\nStep 5. We used email frameworks like OPPS and PSA.\\nAnd 5 more steps.\\n\\nWe detailed our process in our latest newsletter, “Email Prospecting - What Works and What Doesn\\'t.” Link in the comments.\\n\\nCheck it out.\\n\\nWe\\'ve also included a bonus prompt for you.', \"Account planning used to take a minimum of 8 hours/account. \\n\\nNow, it's reduced to just 30 minutes. How? 🤯 \\n\\nThe answer is #AI\\n\\nEarlier, sales reps had to manually research, enter data, and update account plans periodically.\\n\\nNow, AI can handle all the manual steps of the account planning process including a superhuman ability -- 24x7 monitoring and prioritizing thousands of accounts!\\n\\nLet's look at some of these abilities in detail: \\n\\n- AI continuously monitors accounts and highlights those where expansion is more likely (using account prioritization techniques).\\n\\n- AI automates the gathering and synthesis of basic account information like public/private, annual revenue, year started, customer’s vision/strategy, target markets, and financial information.\\n\\n- AI collects data from multiple sources like 10K reports, earnings calls, social media, and news articles, then consolidates it into actionable intelligence.\\n\\n- AI automatically generates and updates outreach communications based on frameworks and real-time insights. It provides time savings like no other technology before.\\n\\n- Current Process without AI: ~850 hours for 100 accounts\\n\\n- New Process with AI: ~50 hours for 100 accounts\\n\\nWe've written more about this in our latest newsletter, “Account Planning using AI in 30 Minutes.” Link in the comments below 👇 \", 'Getting less than a 0.7% \"Reply\" rate, even after adding personalization to your outreach?

Correct?\\n\\nYou will realize that:\\n\\n1. You are not talking about the “deep” and “relevant” pain your prospect might be facing “right now”.\\n\\n2. Your team have missed out on trying to build a relationship, a connection. Even when it was very obvious (for example both the prospect and your sales rep play soccer and have kids)\\n\\n3. You are not coming across as someone who wants to “help” but as someone who wants to “sell”.\\n\\n4. Even when your reps are talking about the problem, they aren’t efficiently tying it back to the solution (especially when you sell many products or complicated solutions)\\n\\nThis is the difference between \"generic\" and \"specific\" personalization.\\n\\nAgree and want to learn more?\\n\\nWe have written more about this in our latest newsletter, \"Your Personalization Workflows: Analyze and Improve.\" Link in the comments below 👇', \"We love Nooks (Power Dialer) but…\\n\\n…even after using it for 5 months we were not satisfied with the results.\\n\\nSatwick had visualized the full potential of it but we were not seeing its impact in the real world.\\n\\nChallenges?\\n\\n1. Total number of dials an SDR can make depends on his/her confidence level for each prospect — more research/insights available more confidence, less research and they are terrified to call.\\n\\n2. Call to conversation ratio — It’s hard to control the connect rate (though you should fully leverage reporting available from Nooks to maximize this) but once the call is connected, improving the conversation rate is totally in the reps hands. Once again research and “pain based insights” really help here.\\n\\nAs we had been building Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0 we thought of solving these two challenges for our team.\\n\\nResults?\\n\\nMeetings doubled with the same number of sales reps 🤯 (see the screenshot below).\\n\\nHow?\\n\\n1.

For example, words like \"free,\" \"guarantee,\" or \"limited time offer\" can trigger personal spam filters.\\n\\n→ Pattern recognition in emails: Buyers have set personal filters for emails starting with \"Hi [FirstName], I hope this email finds you well,\" so these emails automatically go to junk.\\n\\n→ We updated our LinkedIn Page name from \"Evabot\" to \"Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0.\" As a result, we began receiving emails addressed to \"Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0.\" \\n\\nTo avoid spam, we created a filter that sends all emails containing the keyword \"Evabot AI for Sales Outbound 2.0\" directly to the junk folder.\\n\\nHere are the steps we followed internally to achieve a 2x increase in response rates:\\n\\nStep 1. We created a list of words that were common across most emails.\\n\\nStep 2. We conducted account research on our target audience to gather relevant insights. This wasn\\'t just about job changes, acquisitions, or funding congratulations.\\n\\nStep 3. We identified the top insights out of dozens that were highly relevant to the pain points we could solve.\\n\\nStep 4. We prioritized accounts for outreach where the problem was most severe and recent.\\n\\nStep 5.

Your team have missed out on trying to build a relationship, a connection. Even when it was very obvious (for example both the prospect and your sales rep play soccer and have kids)\\n\\n3. You are not coming across as someone who wants to “help” but as someone who wants to “sell”.\\n\\n4.

Total number of dials an SDR can make depends on his/her confidence level for each prospect — more research/insights available more confidence, less research and they are terrified to call.\\n\\n2. Call to conversation ratio — It’s hard to control the connect rate (though you should fully leverage reporting available from Nooks to maximize this) but once the call is connected, improving the conversation rate is totally in the reps hands.

DM me or leave a comment :-)\", 'Everyone is saying \"Outbound is dead\"\\n\\nLet me rephrase -- \\n\"template based outbound... is dead\", \\n\"spray and pray... is dead\"\\n\"tactics based outbound... is dead\"\\n\\nSo what works?\\n\\nI will tell you...\\n\\nBut first... results! \\n\\nWe are booking 2X more meetings with the same number of sales reps in a world where \"outreach is supposed to be dead\" (check my last post).\\n\\nHow?\\n\\nDoing the fundamentals right 👇 \\n\\n✔ Deep research to find the \"pain\" a potential customer is facing that your product can solve for\\n\\n✔ Prioritizing those accounts where the pain is more acute and urgent\\n\\n✔ Finding commonalities, ice-breakers for the prospect\\n\\n✔ Using above 3 to lead with \"pain based personalization\" across cold calls, emails and LinkedIn messages\\n\\n✔ Following a rigorous cadence to do the above steps (with the help of AI of course)\\n\\nSo as you see outbound is not dead, mindless outbound is.

      "content": "List of articles mentioning buying/fact signals Employee Benefits for the company lattice: [{'title': 'How Lattice Built Its Benefits Around Company Values', 'description': 'With more workers than ever quitting their jobs, changing careers, or looking to improve their work lives, companies across the country have been scrambling to attract new workers — and in some cases, struggling to keep the employees they have. It’s been a time of massive upheaval: Pay in many fields has become more competitive, and over two years of hybrid and remote work has reshaped many people’s relationship to the office. Employees are demanding more from employers, and it’s left many companies wondering: Are our benefits what they need to be? Benefits, which traditionally encompass essentials like paid time off (PTO), health insurance (at least in the US), retirement savings accounts, and sick leave, and perks as broad as free in-office meals, health and fitness stipends, and discounts on tickets and travel, have become both a crucial element of employee retention as well as a recruiting advantage in competitive fields. But when it comes to benefit offerings, it’s not always as simple as more is more. ”Organizations are so [eager] to get talent that they just throw stuff at people,” said Maurice Bell, Head of People Operations at Lattice, But taking an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink approach isn’t necessarily the path to success. “You need to make sure your benefits feel authentic — they need to feel intentional,” Bell continued. According to Bell, benefits are one of the ultimate expressions of company culture: It’s one of the first things a new hire learns about a company, and a big part of every employee’s overall experience. So it’s critical, he said, that they reflect the company’s core values. “For someone [who’s] coming into an organization, they should feel like, ‘Oh, of course they offer a 401k match because they’re invested in my growth. Of course they’re offering parental leave because they understand that work is not driving my life,’” said Bell. But creating a benefits package that reflects company values isn’t always a seamless process; figuring out the balance between organizational priorities, financial imperatives, and employee wants and needs can be tricky. Here’s how we did it at Lattice. Lattice’s Values At the heart of Lattice’s organization are four core values that we went to great lengths to identify. These values, which are the framework we use at Lattice to evaluate all business decisions, are: Ship, Shipmate, Self: This value speaks to Lattice’s team-first mentality. As Lattice founder and CEO Jack Altman put it in his book People Strategy: How to Invest in People and Make Culture Your Competitive Advantage , this core value serves as a “reminder to put the company’s well-being and success over that of the individual and to put the well-being and success of our colleagues over our own.” Chop Wood, Carry Water: When it comes to business success, focusing on the task at hand is crucial. “Chop Wood, Carry Water,” inspired by an anecdote in author and leadership coach Joshua Medcalf’s book Chop Wood Carry Water: How to Fall in Love With the Process of Becoming Great , reminds workers at Lattice, or Latticians, of the value of doing the day-to-day work along the way to the desired outcomes. Or, as Altman wrote, “focusing on the process will lead to good results.” Clear Eyes: At Lattice, pragmatism, transparency, ambition, and growth are central to our mission and culture, and “Clear Eyes” sums this up. What’s Next: A growth mindset is integral to Lattice, and “What’s Next” embodies our relentless focus on learning, improving, and looking forward to the next challenge. These values guide the way we look at business opportunities and how we treat our colleagues and clients alike. It’s how we hire new Latticians, too — which is why it’s also the framework we use to evaluate the benefits we offer. How Lattice Views Benefits As a company, Lattice wants to attract best-in-class talent, and that means offering a competitive, compelling benefits package. But there’s more: We want to attract top-tier talent that is also fundamentally aligned with our core values. Bell explained that Lattice’s approach to benefits involves first defining who we are as an organization and what our employer brand is. Then, Bell continued, we reflect on how that gets “reinforced and brought to life through [our] benefits.” But in a world where the kinds of benefits a company can offer are nearly limitless, and constantly growing — but the ability of a business to support them isn’t — deciding exactly which benefits to offer can be a challenge. That’s where our core values come in. How Our Values Determine the Process, Not Just the Outcome Lattice’s core values are at the heart of the process by which we determine what benefits to offer and when. “We’re not an organization that [only] thinks about benefits once a year,” said Bell. “We’re constantly analyzing the value that our benefits offer.” Lattice conducts an employee feedback survey annually to ensure that our benefits package is one that will be valuable to employees — and that our offerings are explicitly in response to what Latticians are asking for, Bell said. Asking employees questions about benefits and reevaluating our offerings based on the responses we get is a direct reflection of our mandate to “Chop Wood, Carry Water,” explained Bell. “We’ve really leaned into meeting folks where they are in the moment,” he said. A big request from employees had been for a 401(k) matching program — a popular benefit for employees, but one the company hadn’t previously offered as it prioritized investment. But communicating company thinking around this particular benefit and how it fit into the larger picture was a critical expression of our value “Clear Eyes.” “We were open and honest, and we had an open dialogue where we could say, ‘Here’s where we are — we’re a relatively early-stage company and we spend more money than we make. We’ve been investing in the organization because we think there’s massive potential,’” Bell said. “We don’t shy away from difficult questions — we try to actively engage in them.” Lattice then took the “What’s Next” directive literally, said Bell. Hearing from employees that building their financial futures with a 401(k) match program was important to them, Lattice began to offer it, as well as access to a financial wellness platform that could connect interested Latticians with financial planners and give them deeper insights into investment for making long-term financial decisions. Benefits at Lattice — like many places — have needed to be adjusted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A preexisting emergency fund that let employees affected by natural disasters take up to seven days off and receive a stipend of $150 per day to put toward food or lodging was codified and expanded to support COVID-positive individuals (or those with exposed family members) so they could isolate safely and with financial support. Lattice also rolled out a wellness bundle that offered access to mental health support, virtual health care, behavioral coaching, and physical therapy at home for isolating workers. The entire benefits package, Bell said, is ultimately a reflection of Lattice’s “Ship, Shipmate, Self” core value in action. “We’re making sure our folks feel cared for — physically, mentally, and emotionally,” he said. “We’re caring for our shipmates and enabling people to take care of themselves.” In fact, all four core values give Lattice a lens through which to examine all benefits decisions, said Bell. “Broadly speaking, we look at our values as a gut check,” he said. “When we consider new ideas, we ask, ‘Does this feel authentic to the employee experience we want to create at our organization?’” How Lattice’s Benefits Are Evolving As We Grow As Lattice has grown (we added 270 new Latticians in 2021 and plan to add another 500 in 2022), keeping benefits aligned with company values has remained essential — but our offerings have needed to evolve as well. “As we’ve grown, we have that much more diversity, not just in employee experience and needs, but we have more voices and more interests, too,” Bell said. “We have a lot of requests to consider.” The 401(k) match is just one example of benefits launched within the past calendar year that grew out of our ongoing dialogue with employees, as is a sabbatical program for all employees and fertility insurance. These new initiatives mark a big step in Lattice’s trajectory — as a younger company, the focus from a benefits standpoint was to create an offering that would resonate broadly with employees. As the firm matures, however, being truly responsive will mean differentiating those benefits. “We’re making sure we’re always thinking about our medical benefits and identifying opportunities to evolve,” said Bell. “Especially as we grow and add more mind power, we’re looking at being competitive [and] reducing costs, but [also] introducing options that just [segments] of the community might need.” — No matter what future benefits are unrolled, the process of identifying them will be rooted in Lattice’s values, Bell assured. “From the people we bring in [to] the benefits we provide to the product we deliver, our values are central,” he said. Is your firm wrestling with its benefits package? Nail down your values first, advised Bell. Not only will it enhance your corporate culture, but in a competitive job market, you’ll be attracting employees who are already aligned with your mission. “Thinking deeply about your values when you make decisions about benefits is another way that reflects those values — they compound each other,” Bell said.'}, {'title': 'What Are Employee Total Rewards and Why Should You Implement ...', 'description': 'Money isn’t everything — especially when it comes to choosing or keeping a job. Sure, offering competitive salaries will improve your business’s ability to attract and retain top talent, but compensation is just one of many factors that make your company a great place to work. Employee benefits, workplace culture, office location, and other non-monetary offerings play a significant role in making your company attractive to prospective employees and fostering loyalty and dedication among your current staff. Think of your own job search: What would you look for in a new role? If you were offered two identical jobs with the same salary, what would persuade you to take one role over the other? It could be better professional growth opportunities, employer-sponsored healthcare benefits, paid parental leave, or more work-life balance. These other factors, while sometimes more qualitative than quantitative, can significantly influence a candidate’s decision to accept or reject a job offer with your company, or an employee’s decision to stay with or leave your organization. That’s why it’s crucial to approach your compensation, benefits, and employee development programs more holistically and fully understand the value each offering provides your employees. This comprehensive approach to employee compensation is called building a “total rewards package,” which can better convey the value of your business’s programs for employee compensation, well-being, benefits, recognition, and development to both current and prospective employees. Here’s a look at what employee total rewards programs are, their benefits, and best practices for adopting this concept within your organization. What Is a Total Rewards Strategy? To define employee total rewards, it’s essential to start by defining total compensation. Total compensation consists of all the monetary rewards an employee earns during a year. In addition to an employee’s salary, total compensation includes other financial benefits like bonuses, commissions, merit awards, and equity. While all of these items make up an employee’s gross pay, total compensation doesn’t factor in any non-monetary benefits an employee receives from their employer, while total rewards, on the other hand, does. \\u200dEmployee total rewards combines both the monetary and non-monetary benefits an employee earns at a company. In addition to gross pay, a total rewards package includes things like traditional benefits (e.g. health, vision, and dental insurance) and voluntary benefits (e.g. disability insurance, financial counseling, or critical illness coverage), retirement plans, vacation time, work-life flexibility, career advancement training programs, and wellness programs. “Companies go to great lengths and considerable expense to position themselves as ‘great places to work;’ however, they typically get little credit from their employees for all of these supposed good works,” said J.D. Pincus, PhD, Vice President at human capital solutions company Leading Indicator Systems. “Part of the reason is that these rewards are never communicated to employees,” Pincus continued. “By sharing the complete reward landscape and how the company provides opportunities for security, inclusion, autonomy, and caring; immersion, personal growth, recognition, and material success; and a reputation for fairness, ethical practices, and higher purpose, it becomes easy to understand the vast non-monetary rewards that employees receive.” Usually, companies calculate each employee’s individual total rewards and present it to them on a total rewards statement, either during annual performance reviews for employees or along with an offer letter for candidates. This helps give employees a better understanding of all the internal programs their organization has set up to help them personally and professionally, as well as better recognize the value they get by working for the company. Benefits of Calculating Employee Total Rewards In addition to letting you think more holistically and strategically about your business’s compensation and benefits plans, calculating your employee total rewards can help you attract, retain, and motivate your workforce. Here’s how. 1. Attract top talent. Sharing employee total rewards can be a powerful recruiting tool. It gives prospective job candidates a more inclusive view of all the benefits that come with working for your company, allowing them to make a more informed decision about your employment offer. In fact, a survey by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that more than 40% of employees said they would take a job with a lower salary for better benefits like flexible work scheduling and the ability to work from home. Survey respondents also shared that they view flexible scheduling as the equivalent of a 9% pay increase and telecommuting as a 4.1% increase. Being upfront about these perks in job descriptions and employment offers can help you win over top talent and seal the deal with candidates who are on the fence. 2. Retain current employees. Adopting an employee total rewards program can also help you retain top talent by educating your employees on your current offerings, thus allowing them to take full advantage of everything your business has to offer. A 2018 survey by risk management and insurance brokerage firm Willis Towers Watson revealed that 78% of workers said they would stay with their current employer because of the benefits it offers. “Businesses that effectively communicate their entire range of benefits stand the best chance of maintaining positive relationships with high-caliber employees,” stated Tony Giacobbe, HR and talent acquisition leader at Amica Senior Lifestyles, a Canadian-based company providing premium retirement residences. “There will be a greater chance of retention as employees are informed of the benefits that they will enjoy at different stages along their career path.” Importantly, educating your employees on all of your benefits and programs can inspire company loyalty and increase tenure. 3. Engage your workforce. Lastly, sharing a personalized total rewards statement with each of your employees allows them to better understand everything they’re getting out of their working relationship with your organization. Insurance company Guardian Life’s Sixth Annual Workplace Benefits Study revealed that 70% of employees said they would be more loyal to a company that offers employee benefits personalized to their needs. A total rewards mindset can help your team build an inclusive benefits package that offers something for every employee. Tying certain benefits to company performance, like annual bonuses and employee recognition programs, can increase employee accountability and encourage employees to meet and exceed individual and company goals. When your employees know how their contributions affect overall company success, they will be more engaged in their work.

Invest in benefits your employees care about. Looking at your compensation and benefits plan holistically lets you be more strategic about your plans for the future, as well as identify gaps in your current offerings. Remember that you’re designing these rewards for your employees, so you should regularly survey them to ensure your current programs meet their present needs. “Find out from your employees what matters to them and build total rewards programs that provide solutions to their needs,” advised Aaron Cleavinger, MBA, CPSM, CPM, Managing Partner at Murdoch Mason Executive Search Group, an executive and strategy consulting firm specializing in consumer-focused companies. “Then, communicate the connection between employee input and company offerings early and often, so they feel connected to the process.” 2. Don’t inflate value. When assembling your personalized total rewards statements for employees, make sure you don’t try to inflate the monetary value of any non-monetary benefits. While unlimited paid time off (PTO) is an attractive perk, it doesn’t warrant a $50,000 price tag, for example. You can estimate the actual value by calculating what the equivalent of their daily pay would be and multiplying that by the number of days off the employee took in the past calendar year. For a prospective job candidate, you can take a similar approach by multiplying their proposed daily pay by the number of PTO days included in your policy or offer, or, if you offer an unlimited PTO plan, use the average number of vacation days your employees took off in the previous year. “Be transparent about the actual costs and benefits of the programs,” stressed Cleavinger. “Employees see through attempts to overemphasize value if they don’t feel positively impacted.” You can even ask your employees how valuable a certain program or policy is to them to help you generate a value for a particular hard-to-quantify offering. 3. Communicate total rewards to employees. Once you’ve calculated every employee’s total rewards package, you need to share it with them. Some companies have software providers that allow them to share statements with employees digitally, while other businesses choose to distribute physical statements to their teams. However your business decides to share statements, be sure you tell employees where they can find their personalized report and remind them to take the time to review it. Most companies choose to share employee total rewards annually, often tying them to performance or salary reviews or the end of the fiscal year, but the timeline is completely up to you. You can make it a practice for managers to print out hard copies of these statements to bring to all their team members’ annual performance reviews, or consider sending an updated digital copy to employees every year during open enrollment. Need some inspiration? Here’s a total rewards statement template from HR, benefits, and insurance firm Towne Benefits. 4. Categorize your statements. Breaking your rewards up into distinct categories can make your statements easier to read and help you identify program gaps. Many companies choose to split their rewards up into five categories: compensation, benefits, work-life, performance and recognition, and employee development. That said, you can pick or define whichever categories work best for you, your business, and your employees. — Keep in mind that every benefit your business offers is designed to help your employees and show that your company takes care of them beyond a paycheck. While some benefits might impact certain employees more than others, it’s your job to design a total rewards package that leaves all your employees feeling supported and valued by your organization. A total rewards statement can be a powerful visual reminder of the financial commitment your business has made in employees’ personal and professional growth. Regularly communicating that to your employees will go a long way toward attracting, retaining, and engaging top talent.'}, {'title': 'RfH Insights: How to Reinvent Your Benefits Package - Lattice', 'description': 'The employee-employer relationship is a lot more complicated these days — the pandemic era has transformed what workers expect from their companies, but the looming recession has forced companies to be a lot more creative about their investments in talent retention. One thing is true for both groups, though: benefits are top of mind for everyone. “The benefits landscape is going to change because Gen Z is moving more towards a freelancer mode and staying in their positions for a shorter time,” said Morgan Williams, head of people and culture at The Newsette and a Resources for Humans (RfH) Ambassador. We know rolling out a benefits package can feel daunting and stressful. Lattice’s RfH Community recently gathered to share their tips and best practices to reduce anxiety and set employees up for success to get the most out of their benefits packages. 1. Do your research. From fertility benefits to wellness stipends, benefits packages have expanded tremendously in just the last few years — and many of those benefits are still relevant in a hybrid workplace. Offering everything you possibly can sounds like the easiest solution, but it’s not realistic or feasible for most companies. Instead, a well-curated benefits package that is meaningful, inclusive, and relevant to employees’ lives is a better way to motivate their performance. “When people are thinking about benefits, they get way too in the weeds with the abundance of options,” said Williams. “Think about the demographics of your employees. What are the things that they would want or need?” HR professionals can reach out to peers at similarly-sized companies in their industry to learn more about common offerings (we think the Resources for Humans Slack community is a great place to start). Community members also advised looking ahead when thinking about total rewards — not every benefit will be relevant to every single employee today, but that can change as companies and employees grow. “Not everyone is using every benefit to its full capacity,” and that’s okay, said Megan Lamberti, a human resources manager at Cahill Contractors LLC and an RfH Ambassador. “It’s not like you’re taking something away from them if they don’t use it.” But, if you want an edge in this competitive labor market, aligning your benefits package to your company values can make a big difference in attracting employees who are already aligned with your mission. 2. Gather feedback from your employees. Like any other corporate initiative, making data-driven decisions is a key to success — in this case, almost all our RfH community members recommended getting feedback on benefits from current employees. Emily Doyle, a people operations specialist at Seesaw Learning, said her company sent out a benefits survey to employees to inform major decisions. “We structured the survey with the things that we’re thinking about,” she said. “It all goes back to listening to employees and picking up on what we’re seeing to understand what they’re actually going to use.” Once the list of potential benefits was narrowed down in another example, employees helped determine “where we should focus and where maybe we weren’t necessarily getting the most bang for our buck,” said Christine Conway, a global benefits manager at Invitae. “The great thing is you already have the buy-in from your employees,” Williams said about surveys. “They’ve told you, you’ve answered. Not only does it help from a benefits perspective, it’s going to help from an engagement perspective, so you should probably have higher enrollment numbers.” 3. Communicate effectively (and often). A truly effective benefits package is one that employees know about. Our community members said communication methods can vary based on company and employee norms. “Some people like to research and discover on their own, while others prefer to have that information given to them,” Lamberti said. Because benefits play an important role in supporting employees during tough times, it’s imperative to share information widely and as often as possible. Some more tactics our members shared included: “We have a benefits Slack channel that’s very active; all new hires get added to it. It’s great because people can crowdsource the information so it’s not just my team having to answer the same question a hundred times. Then we have a pretty robust Wiki with all the information, and our broker [has] an advocate team so all the questions can be funneled there,” Conway said. “We realized there was that gap in knowledge. So we’re going to do “Lunch and Learns” just to put out a little more literature. We’ll make sure employees are aware of how to maximize the use of these benefits, and that they know what’s available to them,” Doyle said. “During difficult times, whenever I’m sending company memos, I often will loop in a document just to remind them about products and the EAP. I have that in a lot of my memos to remind employees it’s there to use because we are paying for it,” Williams said. “We have a town hall every month where I get a few minutes to talk about the benefits we have, whether it’s something tangible or it’s something like our flexible work schedule,” said Danielle Pinc, a business manager at OMNI Institute. 4. When in doubt, be transparent. For teams who want to take it a step further, meeting with employees to break down the whole benefits process can be beneficial to gaining trust and buy-in. “During our compensation review last year, we had the total rewards breakdown with the employer cost and the employee costs, and I just really opened people’s eyes to see, ‘Okay, you are investing in me,’” Doyle said. “Transparency is huge for explaining the decisions and outlining ‘what’s in it for me?’ for employees,” Conway added. — Bringing up benefits can feel like opening the floodgates of total rewards.

While financial incentives may still be plump, ninety-five-hour weeks are becoming headline news. Stress is chronic. Burnout is rising. Talent attraction is harder. Mass layoffs are up. And retention is becoming challenging, with almost 50% of employees indicating turnover intention this year, according to a 2022 EY survey. Industry-wide cultural change is in the works — but that won’t happen overnight. However, one way organisations can help employees navigate this challenging environment is by assembling a meaningful benefits package. Skip ahead to see five creative benefits to boost engagement and morale. How Meaningful Employee Benefits Increase Retention and Engagement Motivation is essential for driving employee engagement and performance. When your employees feel you value, trust, and support them inside and outside of work, they’re more likely to bring their best each day. They’re also likely to feel more committed to your organisation. A well-curated benefits package can be a key player in fostering this environment — but only if it’s meaningful, inclusive, and contributes positively to your employees’ day-to-day lives. “Our benefits support us in building an environment of high performance and accountability,” said Kayleigh Smart, head of People at payroll platform Pento. “They also help our team navigate how work fits into life — this is what we optimise for, rather than rolling out perk after perk.” Using Feedback to Identify the Best Benefits for your Employees Creating a great benefits package that adds value to your employees’ lives depends on knowing what your employees prioritise. To do that, you need feedback — both on your existing benefits, and what might be missing. You can collect this data in a few different ways: Employee engagement survey. Organisations can use data from regular engagement surveys to surface rising trends, and segment data by employee populations to see how priorities differ. For example, if mental well-being feels like a rising trend in your regular survey, you can use this data to adjust mental health support. Pulse survey. A benefits-focused survey may help uncover areas where your package is lacking, and bring new perspectives from your employees on what they really value. Make sure you set clear expectations on how you plan to act on this feedback. Casual check-ins and meetings. One-to-ones, all hands, and employee resource groups can all provide a useful forum for transparent discussion and communication of benefits, advised Smart. When asking for feedback on your benefits directly as part of an engagement or pulse survey, it’s best to ask open-ended questions that help you diagnose how meaningful your employees find their benefits, and any issues in finding or using them: I’m satisfied with [organisation]’s benefits package. I have found it easy to take advantage of [organisation]’s benefits package. I’m satisfied with the health care provision provided by my company. I know how to use [organisation]’s tuition support scheme. Smart suggested checking in yearly to coincide with open enrollment, but advises that organisations stay alert to evolving needs in real-time. It’s also key to keep an eye on utilisation metrics. “Benefits that sound great, but aren’t used by a large proportion of people need to be assessed — are they meaningless, or do they meaningfully serve the needs of a smaller proportion of the team?” she said. “Benefits can also be confusing. [Keeping your eyes and ears open] means you can re-surface, re-communicate, or reshape existing benefits as the business evolves, or easily launch new ones that are more meaningful.” 5 Creative Benefits to Boost Engagement and Morale In the current macroeconomic climate, meaningful employee benefits can have a huge impact on how valued and seen your employees feel at work, as well as alleviating some key stressors. Curating the perfect package will depend on your organisation’s specific needs — especially in the age of remote work. “We operate across 15 countries, and it’s important for us to make sure we meet employee needs for cultural norms in each country we’re taking care of,” said Lovelace, who emphasised a focus on communication. “Your benefits could be really great, but if they’re not relevant to your local employees, or your people don’t understand what they are or know how to use them, they become meaningless. It is something we are constantly working on and talking about on the People team at Airbase.” Here are five key areas you can explore when building a meaningful benefits package for your workforce. 1. Improve work-life balance with paid time off and increased flexibility. According to a 2019 study published in the Personnel Review journal, there’s a three-way link between work-life balance, job satisfaction, and organisational commitment. In an industry with historically higher turnover levels, protecting your employees from overwork, burnout, and stress isn’t just important — it’s paramount. One way to accomplish this is by increasing flexibility around working hours and paid time off (PTO): Unlimited leave: This gives your employees the autonomy to book the leave as they need to recharge. But it only works if employees feel empowered to take the time off — so healthy behaviours around PTO and workloads must be modelled from the top. Flexible working hours: This gives employees freedom, and helps everyone focus on outcomes, not presenteeism. Organisations can make impactful changes with four-day weeks, or flexible shifts that accommodate family and wellbeing needs. 2. Offer benefits for caregivers and parents. The pandemic shone a spotlight on how caregiving duties are a hidden stressor for millions of employees. Providing support for caregivers and parents promotes inclusion, removes stress, and communicates that their contributions matter far more than counting the hours they spend in the office. Options include: Paid caregiving leave: For caregivers, PTO can quickly get filled up with appointments and care needs. Paid caregiving leave gives employees the flexibility to make decisions that work best for them without encroaching on actual vacation time. Flexible parental leave: Paid parental leave is a great starter perk, but organisations can optimise this with increased flexibility. Spotify took this approach back in 2016, with parents able to take six months of fully paid flexible leave up until their child’s third birthday. Inclusive perks: Gym memberships and out-of-hours activities are unlikely to feel inclusive to parents and caregivers if they don’t have time to participate. Organisations can consider a range of more inclusive perks for working parents and caregivers, including on-site childcare or childcare subsidies, fertility benefits, adoption support, and care sabbaticals. 3. Take a holistic approach to employee well-being. When it comes to employee wellness, we often think of benefits that promote physical well-being, like health insurance, dental coverage, or a gym membership. But as mental health concerns grow in the financial services sector, employees are increasingly looking to their company for support in all aspects of their well-being. Examples may include: Physical well-being stipend: A flexible well-being stipend gives employees the autonomy to choose from a range of classes or service providers that work for them based on their preference and location. Mental health support: Employee Assistance Programmes can provide fast access to support when wait times are long. Organisations can also consider providing a subsidy for therapy sessions or other professional mental health services. Mental health leave: A 2019 survey by Censuswide and Slater and Gordon found that 55% of employees taking time off for mental health reported their leave as a sick day. Offering mental health leave can help normalise a company culture around well-being — but organisations must create a space where employees feel safe sharing. LGBTQ+ support: Many organisations, including Airbnb, offer medical and mental health support for transgender employees, including counselling, gender confirmation surgery cover, and travel costs. 4. Create pathways for professional development. In our 2021 Career Progression Survey, we found almost 50% of employees are actively looking or considering a new role with better growth opportunities — and the financial services sector is certainly not immune to this trend. With research suggesting that overall tenure is down, and employee numbers are dropping in this sector, professional development benefits could be your differentiator to retain top talent. Examples include: Education benefits: Education benefits demonstrate you care about employee development. Student loan assistance and tuition reimbursement are popular options, but organisations can also consider a 529 plan — a tax-advantaged savings account to help save for future learning. Learning support and stipends: Stipends enable employees to curate their learning according to their professional goals. Smart said tools can meaningfully increase accessibility: “Our People and Talent team is currently assessing some aspects of our employee experience, such as accessibility barriers. Easy access to screen readers and spell checkers can help fill some accessibility gaps.” 5. Empower financial wellness. With increased global uncertainty around job security, it’s little wonder that almost half of the workforce are struggling with financial distress, according to a 2022 CIPD report. Financial stress negatively impacts employee mental well-being, as well as their ability to perform at work, making financial wellness benefits a rising trend. Organisations can offer financial support in a couple of ways: Retirement plan: Times are uncertain, and employees are increasingly looking to their organisation for support for when they leave the workforce. Organisations can help employees plan for the future by increasing their tax-free contributions, or offering a 401k match. Financial well-being: A 2021 report by CIPD revealed only 11% of employers actively focus on their employees’ financial well-being. Meaningful financial well-being benefits include access to financial management tools, or individual, tailored coaching. Feedback is a Vital Tool in Shaping Employee Benefits As retention and talent attraction continue to be a sector-wide challenge, financial services organisations must stay cognisant of current macroeconomic circumstances, and adjust their benefits packages accordingly. Leveraging employee feedback on how your employees feel about their benefits during this time is vital to make sure your offering stays meaningful, inclusive, and relevant to your employees’ lives. Taking an intentional approach to benefits will not only provide your employees with vital support during tough times, but it will become a key differentiator in attracting and retaining a great workforce.'}, {'title': 'What Is a Career Lattice?', 'description': 'Career growth isn’t about staying in your lane. If the corporate ladder represents how people used to think about professional growth, the career lattice is its successor. A career lattice is a career progression pathway that allows for vertical, horizontal, and diagonal movement. In layperson’s terms, that means employees don’t have to stay in their departments to grow. There’s a demand for this kind of flexibility, as one survey found that nearly 90% of workers would consider a cross-departmental move without a financial incentive. “The career lattice expands the traditional ladder to include diagonal job growth, allowing employees to explore and grow their careers by moving across the company, into varied roles that offer competency development,” said Jessica Lim, HR Manager at LiveCareer. “This type of career strategy creates a more well-rounded understanding of the company and the industry, and how each department contributes.” Why Career Lattices Are Worth It Career lattices aren’t a one-sided perk meant to cater to employees who are feeling bored or restless. There’s a strong business case for keeping top talent in-house, even if they don’t neatly conform to one department. “We’ve been experimenting with the career lattice model for a while and we’ve seen some great results. We were able to hang onto some of our best people this way,” said Hosea Chang, Chief Operating Officer at Hayden Los Angeles. As his team discovered, the most talented employees often have skills that can be applied elsewhere. An adept project manager can get things done in marketing or engineering. A great communicator can keep clients happy or close lucrative deals. “It starts with asking, ‘If this stellar employee has done such a great job in their department, what else can they do?’” Chang said. As an added benefit, finding these skills internally means companies can save on recruiting. Since career lattices facilitate lateral movement within the company, they can have the long-term effect of breaking down boundaries between teams. Cross-departmental collaboration comes more naturally when you have employees that have served multiple teams. Experts added that career lattices can also be used to bring outside perspectives to teams that are feeling stuck. “Flexibility in career development not only increases employee satisfaction but also benefits your organization by fostering knowledge transfer. When employees switch teams, they can bring fresh perspectives to the table and drive the company forward,” Lim said. For example, a client service professional can help a marketing team better empathize with customers and ensure its messaging doesn’t come off as out of touch. How to Support Lateral Movement Cory Colton, an executive coach at Inflection Point Coaching, spent over 20 years leading learning and development (L&D) teams at companies like Cox and Citigroup. Having implemented career lattices at several organizations, he knows the first step is getting buy-in from the top. While HR can advise on strategy, only executive leadership can get everyone on board. Their endorsement will especially matter when managers might be reluctant to part ways with their reports. “Executives need to identify talent development and career growth as a strategic imperative…The business should partner in, or take lead on, the structure for the career lattice. It should be tied to the overall strategy of the company and help it move forward toward growth and sustainability,” Colton said. To further discourage managers from “talent hoarding,” he said that executive leadership should set goals around internal hiring. Next, HR and recruiting teams should advertise openings internally, early and often. Consider sharing a pared-down version of the job description that focuses on transferable skills. Distilling job openings to their key competencies can cut through jargon that would otherwise make them seem unapproachable to someone outside that department. “HR teams should create a listing board where managers can post the availability of opportunities. New roles should be emailed to all employees so that they’re aware of those options,” said Ian Kelly, VP of Operations at NuLeaf. Others recommended that HR teams and hiring managers walk through internal openings during all-hands meetings and share them via messaging apps like Slack. Encourage interested employees to apply and consult with their manager during an upcoming one-on-one. If your recruiting team uses an applicant tracking system, add a custom field to flag internal applications as they come in. From there, HR teams should discuss the viability of the move with both the employee’s current manager and the one hiring for the role. In companies where career conversations are already the norm, the former shouldn’t be caught off guard. Whether or not the news comes as a surprise, Colton recommends that someone on your HR or L&D team facilitate the conversation. — People aren’t one dimensional — so why should their careers be? More than half of U.S. workers say they’ll probably change careers someday. Three-quarters of millennials say they will. For business and HR leaders like Lim, replacing the traditional ladder with the career lattice isn’t just about being a progressive, people-centric business. It’s a matter of survival. Why go against the tide? Top performers in any field are a rarity — hold onto the ones you have. “People are going to look for new passions and development areas during their careers. Why not give them the possibility to develop their passions within your organization?” she said.'}, {'title': \"HR's Guide to Employee Assistance Programs - Lattice\", 'description': 'The current global health crisis and all the hardship it’s brought about have underscored the importance of prioritizing employee mental health. While it’s been uplifting to witness teams go the extra mile to support one another, sometimes professional help is what’s truly needed. Employee assistance programs (EAPs) help employees by supporting them through a variety of challenges. But although most companies offer them, many employees aren’t even aware these services exist or know how they work, much less take advantage of them. Here’s what you need to know to create an impactful EAP offering at your company that will benefit everyone, especially during this tough time. What Is an EAP? Let’s start with the basics: EAPs are an employer-sponsored benefit that provide support to employees for a broad range of issues. The modern-day EAP evolved from occupational alcoholism programs of the 1940s, and today EAPs offer services for a wide variety of needs. Here are some of the issues that EAPs can address. Mental Health Concerns Depression, anxiety, adult ADHD, and substance abuse are just a few mental health concerns that EAPs can help with. These issues may be blatantly affecting employee performance at work, like causing employees to miss deadlines or come into the workplace under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Or the stress of unaddressed mental health concerns may be more subtle, affecting your employees’ ability to focus, communicate, and be a productive team member. Workplace Conflicts Conflict is naturally going to arise in the workplace from time to time. There’s no way to avoid it, but handling it sensitively and skillfully can make all the difference, which is where EAPs come in. Mediation or conflict resolution through an EAP can help employees work through the issue — whether it’s with a peer or a supervisor — constructively, so employees can move past it and it doesn’t get in the way of their daily performance at work. Childcare Sourcing childcare can feel like a full-time job, on top of having a full-time job. When parents work, carving out enough time to find nurturing, secure, and affordable childcare is not an easy feat. EAPs can alleviate stress by undertaking this search for working parents. Elder Care Today, in addition to caring for a partner and/or children, many working adults are also responsible for the care of their aging parents, who may be facing physical or mental decline. This is an incredibly emotional and stressful burden to bear, and once again, EAPs can provide some relief. In this instance, EAPs can offer support to caregivers through counseling, or provide adult day care services for those suffering from conditions like Alzheimer’s or those who need supervision throughout the day. Grief Counseling Most companies offer some sort of bereavement leave, but grief is a process that requires ongoing support, and isn’t going to be neatly wrapped up by the time the employee has to return to work. EAPs provide services that help employees work through the emotionally devastating experience of losing a loved one, like one-on-one grief counseling or on-site workshops to help teams better understand how to support grieving coworkers in the workplace. Legal Guidance Occasions arise when employees need legal advice, whether they’re going through a divorce or dealing with a child suffering from substance abuse. Comprehensive EAPs can also help in this arena, too, by providing discounted legal services for employees. With many EAPs, the initial legal consultation is free and subsequent services are available at a discounted rate. These include standard legal services like preparing a will or assisting with divorce proceedings, adoptions, or juvenile defense. Financial Services Amid the day-to-day grind, people often don’t have the time and energy to take stock of their finances and plan for their financial future. Some EAPs include professional financial services to help employees and their immediate family members tackle big financial hurdles, like saving for a down payment on a home, creating a plan for retirement, or investing for the first time. Crisis Counseling Management In the aftermath of an acute crisis like a death in the workplace, natural disaster, or other traumatic event, EAPs can dispatch counselors to support employees in the office. They can also provide support through an ongoing crisis, such as what we’re currently experiencing with the COVID-19 outbreak. Types of EAPs Through your company’s EAP, you have the opportunity to provide really impactful services for your employees, so selecting the right model is important. Two common ways they’re offered is as an addition to your company’s healthcare plan or as a standalone option. Let’s take a closer look at the two most common models of EAPs. Bundled EAPs Some EAPs are packaged as part of an employer’s long-term disability or health insurance plan. A bundled plan presents the opportunity for employer savings, but this EAP model rarely provides the services of a comprehensive program, and the governing body of EAP professionals, the Employee Assistance Professionals Association (EAPA), warns against them. “Buyers can and have been misled by unscrupulous group practices, counseling or healthcare providers, insurance companies and brokers who sell a traditional mental health service plan and tack on a limited employee counseling or referral service. This is not an EAP,” said the EAPA in their EAP Buyer’s Guide. This is because bundled EAPs often lack contact with the workplace, can include unexpected fees, and can even lack qualified providers. The association recommends full-service, standalone EAPs as a better option for a sound EAP with quality, comprehensive services. Standalone EAPs These EAPs are not part of an insurance company but rather an altogether separate entity. Proponents of standalone EAPs highlight the flexibility and opportunity for partnership they offer, as standalone EAPs are nimble enough to create customized programming for a company. “A true partnership includes being aware of what’s going on in an organization, whether it’s navigating a company merger or supporting an employee’s personal issues” said Karen Laos, EAP consultant and longtime HR specialist. “The key is being embedded in the fabric of the organization enough to understand what their needs are without having to ask,” Laos said. Similarities Between the Two Whether you choose an EAP that’s bundled as part of your health insurance plan or go with a standalone offering, both EAPs will likely have some similarities, like the way payment works. Unlike healthcare plans, employees are not required to pay for EAPs. For most plans, employers subsidize 100% of the cost of counseling services for a predetermined number of sessions, usually between one and five. If after using those initial sessions the employee is referred for additional visits, those will likely be covered by their healthcare plan. In other cases, employers may elect to subsidize a portion of the cost, with employees responsible for covering the rest. But it’s important to note that this may differ depending on the service the employee is seeking. For example, adult care day care services and legal services may not ever be fully subsidized. Both bundled and standalone EAPs share similarities in how their services may be accessed, too. Quality EAPs that abide by ethical standards have a direct contact method, so individuals don’t have to rely on HR to connect them to these confidential services. Factors to Consider Selecting an EAP comes with a lot of considerations. In addition to choosing an EAP model and service offering that meets a large spectrum of your employees’ needs, you’ll want to ensure your choice offers remote counseling services and makes employee confidentiality a top priority. Remote Counseling Services When you’re selecting an EAP, consider how employees will access the services. Teletherapy was once seen as an undesirable option, but today it’s how many people choose to access their counseling or mental health services — even before the coronavirus pandemic created our new reality. Shin-Di Lai, RN and registered acupuncturist, appreciates teletherapy because it keeps her on a regular schedule. “I prefer to be in person [for my therapy appointments],” Lai said. “However, telemedicine for mental health and therapy is an amazing option to maintain consistency. It’s actually more convenient sometimes, as I often struggled to find the time to travel to my therapist’s office,” she said. While some may be skeptical about the effectiveness of teletherapy, for many people there’s still great benefit in a video visit when they can’t meet with their mental health practitioner face to face. “Research has shown that teletherapy via video is comparable in effectiveness to in-person psychotherapy,” said Michael Carollo, PsyD, New York City-based psychological fellow and outpatient therapist. “It’s been found to be particularly effective at helping individuals adjust to stressful events, manage life transitions, improve interpersonal relationships, and reduce the impacts of depression and anxiety,” he said. Employee Confidentiality EAPs exist to help employees work through tough times. But sometimes employees are reluctant to take advantage of these services because they fear that it won’t be kept confidential. As long as an employee is voluntarily using the service, EAPs are bound by law — and a code of ethics — to protect employee confidentiality. The only exception is when an individual shares information that they are hurting themself or others, or if children are being neglected. The online nature of therapy during social distancing has raised other concerns about confidentiality, but Carollo said patients needn’t worry: “The client and therapist connect via a secure and encrypted video platform to hold the session and ensure confidentiality,” he said. Employer Advantages of an EAP It’s no secret we’re heading into uncertain economic times. With a looming recession, employers may be considering trimming employee benefits as a cost-saving measure. But before slashing your organization’s budget for EAPs, consider the value they provide — especially during turbulent times when employees can greatly benefit from this type of support. The stress of an economic downturn is difficult enough in and of itself, but it can also magnify other issues employees may be struggling with. Marital or relationship tension could be exacerbated by financial woes, quality childcare becomes challenging to afford, and rates of substance dependence or abuse increase. Employers can support their employees by providing comprehensive EAPs. In turn, employers benefit from a more content and focused workforce. Here are some things offering an EAP can do for your company. Increase Productivity According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), lost productivity is estimated to cost US employers $1,685 per employee per year. Oftentimes a distracted worker has a heavy personal burden they’re trying to manage, and stressed employees have higher rates of absenteeism. Bolster Employee Value Proposition An employee value proposition (EVP) is the unique combination of tangible and intangible benefits and rewards an organization offers its employees. A strong EVP frames employees as internal clients to impress. Providing support for a broad range of issues employees and their families may face is a key component of that. Provide Cost Savings As a tool that can increase employee productivity, bring down healthcare costs through early intervention, and build a more engaged workforce, thoughtfully selected EAPs are a powerful cost-saving measure. How to Encourage Employees to Use EAPs Creating an EAP is only half the battle; it’s not doing any good if employees aren’t using it. HR includes information about EAPs as part of the onboarding process, but in many cases that’s the last time it’s mentioned. Here are some ways to make sure this benefit is top of mind for your employees. 1. Get creative about reminding employees regularly. Laos said it’s common to highlight EAPs when an employee joins a company and then never discuss it again. “When I was in HR, I was guilty of the same thing — but you have to be really intentional about reminding employees of this service,” Laos said. “It’s a true benefit, and HR should work to make it more prominent by reminding employees once a quarter and exploring other opportunities to promote services, like through email campaigns,” she said. 2. Take a top-down approach. Karen Condor, a research editor for an auto insurance comparison site, has taken advantage of EAPs on three separate occasions. But to do so required her to take the initiative. “In all three instances, employers only mentioned their EAP as part of employee benefits at new-hire orientations and at annual benefits reviews,” she said. Condor thinks the benefit should be emphasized from the top down. “Executives should encourage management to promote EAPs. It would be easy to incorporate it as part of a talk with an employee when expressing concern about that employee’s performance,” she said. 3. Highlight services when they’re needed most. Online support group 7Chairs, which works with EAPs, has seen a spike in recent activity. They’ve facilitated groups for recently laid-off employees and helped others adjust to working from home. \\u200dIrad Eichler, 7Chairs CEO and cofounder, said the organization is also working with first responders at various hospitals to deal with the emotional side of the coronavirus’ effect on their daily lives. “These employees are in bind right now, and getting help and support might not be the first thing on their minds,” Eichler said. “We felt appreciated from both the participating employees and the managers for the impact the groups had on their employees,” he said. Making for a Better Workplace May is Mental Health Awareness Month, and we’re in the middle of a global health crisis, so there’s never been a better time to highlight your organization’s EAP or consider investing in the service. The benefits could make a huge difference in the lives of your employees and the overall health of your company. “Whenever I’ve shared my EAP experience with a coworker, they’re initially shocked…then intrigued,” Condor said. “I think heightened awareness could help so many other employees, and in turn make for a better workplace,” he said.'}, {'title': 'Show Benefits in Total Compensation - Lattice Help Center', 'description': 'Not yet followed by anyone Problem Include benefits in the Total Compensation view Make benefits visible to employees Resolution We understand the important role benefits play in helping employees understand their rewards, and plan to build out additional functionality to allow teams to value and display benefits for their employees.

There’s no clear record of the first performance review, but Harvard Business Review reported that by the 1940s, 60% of companies were conducting performance appraisals. Yet, despite having more than 80 years to perfect this practice, most companies still think their performance management process falls short: The 2019 Global Performance Management Study by asset management and research firm Mercer found that only 2% of companies worldwide believe their performance process delivers high value, and only 2% believe they have excellent feedback practices. This data starts to get at the heart of the problem with the traditional annual review performance management systems — the process has historically focused on analyzing past performance, rather than providing the feedback, resources, and coaching needed to improve performance for the future. Amending your performance management process to include continuous feedback, a system to more regularly facilitate the exchange of feedback within an organization, is a smart way to build a better performance management strategy. Let’s take a closer look at continuous feedback, its benefits, and the value it can bring to your organization. What Is Continuous Feedback? Continuous feedback is a Human Resource strategy that seeks to encourage and empower the exchange of feedback on a regular basis between managers and employees, as well as peer-to-peer. Some of the key features of continuous feedback are: 1. It complements performance reviews. Continuous feedback and performance reviews don’t have to be an either-or situation. “Continuous feedback and annual performance reviews aren’t mutually exclusive,” said Daivat Dholakia, Director of Operations at fleet-tracking app Force by Mojio. “In fact, they’re highly compatible.” Dholakia said companies that rely on both to strengthen their performance management strategy will benefit from a more streamlined annual and mid-year review process, while supporting employees in meeting their goals along the way. “Since continuous feedback allows employees to constantly receive information and evaluations about their work, annual performance reviews can function more like an overarching long-term retrospective on each employee’s progress and goal achievement,” Dholakia noted. 2. It includes informal feedback — but isn’t limited to it. Cultures of continuous feedback include the impromptu “Great job!” exchanged in passing, but aren’t limited to informal affirmations. At the heart of successful continuous feedback programs is a strategy that ties together goal-setting, constructive feedback, everyday praise, and open communication between managers and employees, and peer-to-peer. “Informal continuous feedback models without a formalized plan almost always fail,” cautioned Janelle Owens, Director of HR for online education company Test Prep Insight. “Managers start skipping reviews, employees get sheepish asking for feedback, and feedback slowly comes to a stop.” To counter this, Owens said HR departments should crystallize a formal plan, like with any other performance management system. “By memorializing the plan in writing, your organization is much more likely to stay committed,” she said. 3. It relies on one-on-ones as a cornerstone. While feedback should be exchanged informally, both in-person and digitally, a continuous feedback system relies on regular check-ins between managers and employees. “You’ve used hallway chat to talk about the great [job an employee has done] and the opportunities [you see for them], and the one-on-one is where you can dive deep on them,” said executive coach James Osborn. \\u200dOne-on-ones ensure performance conversations are taking place regularly. “They’re the weekly checkpoint to look at progress, and to summarize what’s happened and what’s up next,” Osborn said. Mercer’s 2019 Global Performance Management Study also found that employee feedback is most effective when it is “specifically connected to the employee and personalized to the learning experiences that will accelerate their contribution and acquisition of new skills.” As well as providing a dedicated time to share feedback with employees, one-on-ones are also a chance for managers and employees to get to know each other better so managers can provide more personalized feedback to their direct reports, thus increasing the efficacy of their feedback. 4. It helps employees meet their goals and OKRs. An important feature of continuous feedback is the frequency of checking-in: Managers and employees will be having regular conversations to discuss performance, progress, and opportunities for improvement, which supports employees in meeting both their short-term objectives and long-term goals. “When there [are] regular progress check-ins against a set of goals, it’s easier to design action plans on the part of the employee and prioritize objectives to raise productivity,” said Michael Hammelburger, CEO of The Bottom Line Group, a cost-reduction and tax analysis firm. Continuous feedback eliminates the lag time of the traditional annual review, where employees are receiving feedback on events that may have long since passed. Instead, the regular cadence of conversations and feedback inherent in the continuous feedback model helps employees adjust where needed, and offers managers the opportunity to remove blocks or provide resources to help employees meet their objectives. Benefits of Continuous Feedback Consider supplementing your organization’s performance management system with a framework of ongoing feedback to take advantage of the following benefits of continuous feedback: 1. It drives employee growth. Implementing a system of continuous feedback facilitates regular conversations around employee growth and development. And since short- and long-term OKRs are a key part of any successful continuous feedback framework, employees will be taking an active role in setting and discussing goals with managers, which boosts employee development. 2. It provides real-time insights. Thanks to the open, honest conversations and actionable suggestions regularly occurring between managers and employees, continuous feedback helps address issues and remove barriers before they become problems that threaten project or team success — or even worse, result in high employee turnover. Because employees are routinely receiving information on what they’re doing well and where they can improve, continuous feedback also helps mitigate the risk for recency bias — where a manager is primarily focusing on an employee’s most recent successes or shortcomings — which can be a common pitfall when substantial feedback is only being delivered one or two times a year, as happens when relying solely on more formal reviews. 3. It improves employee engagement. According to an article on Gallup, “research shows that having conversations about development can improve employee engagement, which can in turn improve productivity and profitability.” We also know that the employee-manager relationship is an important component of high employee engagement. The Predictive Index’s People Management Study revealed that the amount of feedback an employee receives is closely correlated with how highly they rate their manager. In fact, “when it comes to how much feedback managers give, employees give higher marks to managers who err on the side of giving too much rather than too little,” noted the study. 4. It facilitates stronger relationships. Feedback requires vulnerability on the part of the person giving the feedback and the person receiving it. For the individual offering feedback, they must summon the courage to share their observations or experiences, and for the receiver, they must be open to hearing someone else’s opinion of their performance or behavior. But it’s precisely this vulnerability that bolsters psychological safety — the belief that an individual will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes — and therefore helps staff members build stronger relationships at work. The Link Between Feedback and High-Performance Cultures Because Carter was adamant about using technology to facilitate feedback, Patagonia was able to identify trends around feedback and performance. “Before technology, things happened in the dark. We had no idea what was going on,” said Carter in his interview on XM Blog. But with the use of technology, the company found that employees who regularly exchanged feedback performed at a higher level — and received bonuses that reflected that. According to Carter, employees who regularly exchanged feedback through Patagonia’s digital system were more likely to hit their goals, and received 20% higher bonuses. Figures that, when we consider what we know about ongoing feedback — that it helps employees grow, provides real-time insights, boosts employee engagement, and strengthens relationships at work — shouldn’t surprise us. For businesses looking to strengthen their performance management strategy and build a high-performing workplace culture, implementing a system of continuous feedback is an effective way to achieve this.

According to U.S. census data, nearly half of households are doing just that. Working parents report feeling more stressed, tired, and rushed than their colleagues — and the data backs that up. But in addition to making up a sizeable chunk of the workforce, these employees bring unique perspectives to the table, making them a critical part of your talent strategy and diversity and inclusion goals. So what can HR teams do to help lighten the load for working parents and make them feel included? Here are a few strategies to consider. 1. Get a baseline from survey data. From measuring eNPS to belonging, employee surveys can be used to track sentiment in a few different ways. While company-wide metrics can give you a gut check as to how your workforce is feeling as a whole, look at specific cross-sections for more telling insights. If you’re already looking at engagement by ethnicity, age, or other demographics, consider adding another data point to the mix: family status. If your employee survey tool supports custom fields, report on how parents’ scores compare to other workers’. Using software like Lattice, you can even identify outliers in specific offices or departments. Running surveys can help you diagnose problems, identify solutions, and even grade past initiatives. Look at historical data to see whether a new perk or offering has made a difference. Employee feedback will help you pivot or fine-tune your HR programs. For more examples of how to respond to employee feedback, read our ebook on engagement survey action planning. 2. Make flexibility a workplace norm. Over the last decade, the advice has been to offer employees more, not less flexibility — whether in respect to their scheduling or physical location. But though up to 96% of workers say they want flexibility, less than half actually have it. And arguably no segment of the workforce needs it more than parents. Raising a family doesn’t lend itself to predictable scheduling. Snow days, softball games, and surprise calls from the school nurse might require parents to stay home or sign off early. Now, school cancelations during the COVID-19 outbreak have given most companies a crash course in how important it is to offer that flexibility. If employees’ jobs can be done remotely, managers should allow them to stay home. If the nature of the job doesn’t allow for remote work, consider offering other forms of leave or flexible time off so employees can accommodate family obligations. Offering flexibility also makes good business sense. While flexibility isn’t a “benefit” in a traditional sense like health or dental insurance are, employees consider it just as valuable. According to one survey, working parents even ranked greater flexibility over higher salaries. Chane Steiner, CEO of Crediful, has seen that dynamic play out firsthand at his company. “Employees end up saving money on transportation, childcare, and any number of other costs involved with a typical nine-to-five job. Flexibility can even convince employees to stay because they look at it as part of their benefits package. Maybe the pay isn’t higher, but the overall benefits make it worthwhile in the end,” Steiner said. 3. Offer paid parental leave. Offering paid leave for new mothers and fathers isn’t just considered best practice, in some jurisdictions, it’s a legal requirement. States including California, New Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island all mandate paid leave. Austin, New York City, San Francisco, Seattle, and 15 other major cities also have paid family leave programs. So how much time should companies offer? While there isn’t a “magic number” that works for every organization, consider offering at least 12 weeks of paid leave to both full-time and part-time employees. Not only will this number keep you in compliance with most state and local laws, but it’ll also give employees flexibility if they need more time. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, the average maternity leave lasts 10 weeks. If you want to set yourself apart from the competition, consider offering even more generous benefits. Companies including Alphabet, Facebook, Square, and Zendesk offer as much as 18 weeks of paid leave. Some companies even allow employees to return in phases. “In our office, there is a flexible arrangement of ‘gradual return’ for the employees,” said John Steeve, an HR Manager at Brandnic. Since implementing the policy four years ago, Steeve noticed a dip in turnover among new parents. “It’s given them a balance between their work and any major event in their life,” he said. 4. Make employee perks inclusive. Come open enrollment season, HR teams spend weeks laboring over how to make their benefits and total rewards packages generous as possible. Ensuring that they’re inclusive is just as important. In addition to popular perks like gym discounts and tuition reimbursement, consider including a few that cater specifically to working parents with both younger and adolescent children. Today, HR teams can implement a few perks that directly and indirectly support working parents, including: Adoption assistance Back-to-school stipends “Baby cash” cash payments for parents of newborns Childcare stipends Entertainment discounts Experiential incentives and gifts Fertility benefits Financial wellness programs Contributions to 529 college savings plans Maternity concierge services Sabbatical leave for tenured employees In addition to offering some of the above perks, continue encouraging employees to leverage your employee assistance program (EAP). Though the vast majority of U.S. companies offer these free counseling services, just 7% of employees actually leverage them. Working parents are asked to shoulder a lot — and could probably use a reminder that the services are there and completely confidential. Spend an upcoming company all-hands reminding your workforce of the free benefit and how to use it. While some companies go as far as to fly nannies cross-country for their employees, you don’t need lavish perks to make a difference. Oftentimes, it’s just a matter of how you position your existing programs. If part of your employee experience includes regular team offsites or happy hours, make sure they’re inclusive of parents and those with family obligations at home. That might mean starting events earlier in the day, or if appropriate (and not in the midst of a pandemic) welcoming families onsite. — \\u200d Working parents account for a major share of the U.S. workforce (and likely, your company), making it critical that HR teams keep them in mind when tracking engagement.

As it turns out, it just may be. Yet despite the significant benefits of recognition, employees receive too little of it. Data from Gallup found that only 22% of individual contributors strongly agree that they “receive the right amount of recognition for the work [they] do” — numbers that are unsurprising, considering other Gallup data reported that almost two-thirds of leaders say there’s no budget specifically for recognition. So what exactly is the value of recognition in the workplace and how can we build a culture around it? Below, we’ll take a closer look at the importance of recognition from peers as well as leaders, the tangible benefits organizations can reap by encouraging more of it, and some of the most common and effective ways to implement this at your organization. The ROI of Recognition When it comes to recognition, commending colleagues for a job well done goes beyond just providing a mood boost. One workplace engagement report found that “when employees believe they will be recognized, they are 2.7 times more likely to be highly engaged.” And Gallup’s 2022 report Transforming Workplaces Through Recognition found that in companies that excel at recognition, employees are “56% less likely to be looking or watching for job opportunities,” and “five times as likely to feel connected to their [company’s] culture.” Creating a company culture of recognition — the act of showing gratitude for others’ work, actions, or ideas — positively influences satisfaction in the workplace, too. A study published in the academic journal Psychology found that employees benefit from a greater sense of satisfaction from their job when they believe “their workplace culture…endorses gratitude.” Research consistently shows that recognition leads to a host of benefits in the workplace, but receiving credit for a great idea or being thanked for taking on extra work doesn’t have to fall exclusively on managers; peer-to-peer recognition is important, too. Where Recognition Should Come From While recognition from managers may confer a sense of prestige or contribute to a feeling of heightened job security, peer-to-peer recognition has its own purposes and benefits. Gallup’s workplace recognition report found that employees want recognition from peers just as much as from their leaders. Perhaps that’s because it’s often our peers who best understand the challenges we face in the workplace. For example, say you pitched a new potential client after weeks of ever-changing requests and evolving deadlines from your contact at the company. What’s worse, your manager was tied up with other responsibilities and very hands off during the project. After the pitch, your manager tells you, “Great job! I think they were really impressed!” But if you hear from one of your teammates, “You really delivered on that pitch! I know how stressful it’s been to have all those changing requests from X client, and at times it felt like we’d never get it done. I think you really impressed everyone!” — that will potentially have a bigger impact. Regardless of who the recognition comes from, it’s important to ask people how they’d like to receive recognition, said Emily Goodson, founder of culture-focused HR consulting firm CultureSmart. While this might seem like a more natural conversation topic between a manager and their direct report, peers shouldn’t feel shy about initiating these discussions with each other, too. Managers can even help facilitate these exchanges by asking all their staff members to share their recognition preferences during a team meeting, for instance. Facilitating these types of exchanges will encourage more recognition and further benefit the team and workplace. Workplace Benefits of Peer Recognition 1. It builds stronger teams — especially in hybrid environments. You want your employees to feel connected to their team, culture, and organization, but this can be more challenging to achieve in a remote or hybrid workplace. Encouraging peer feedback and recognition can help reinforce relationships and build new connections among team members, regardless of where they’re working. The Gallup research showed that individuals who receive peer feedback at least a few times a month are twice as likely to strongly agree that they have meaningful connections with their colleagues. And strong peer relationships can positively contribute to psychological safety, which has been identified again and again as a key component of high-performing teams in research by Microsoft and Harvard Business Review , among others. “It’s no secret that staff [members] are more likely to be engaged in their jobs when they feel supported and appreciated in their work environment,” said Miriam Groom, human capital strategist, industrial and organizational (IO) therapist, and founder of career coaching service Mindful Career. “Positive reinforcement can go a long way in terms of bolstering someone’s sense of self-esteem and belonging, both of which are essential to creating an environment in which people feel invested in what they’re doing.” Recognition is a way for employees to help one another feel seen and valued, and foster a sense of togetherness. “Not only does it give employees the opportunity to celebrate their colleagues’ successes, but it also helps to build a sense of community and connection — both of which are essential for strong team dynamics,” said Groom. 2. It keeps company values top-of-mind. Peer-to-peer recognition supports company culture and can keep organizational values top-of-mind for employees. And with Lattice’s Praise feature, which integrates directly with Slack, employees are prompted to align their commentary with a company value when submitting praise. HR professionals believe this kind of alignment between values and recognition strategy is the most effective: Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) research found that HR rated employee recognition programs higher when they were tied to organizational values and talent strategy. 3. It increases employee motivation. Without adequate recognition, employee motivation is likely to dip. According to research by global talent market and workforce analyst, educator, and thought leader Josh Bersin, one of the top reasons employees feel demotivated at work is a lack of recognition. There is a unique sense of motivation that comes from acknowledgement for a job well done from those we respect. Being appreciated, valued, and seen encourages us to continue to do great work. “Peer recognition helps make employees feel more valued, and can be a great motivator,” said Groom. “When staff [members] know their work is recognized by one another, they’re more likely to go above and beyond in the future.” 4. It boosts employee retention. Recognition boosts engagement, and, according to the Gallup research, workers who feel appreciated and recognized by others in their company are more likely to stay at an organization. An article in Harvard Business Review reported that airline carrier JetBlue’s peer-to-peer recognition program has resulted in a host of benefits for the business, with JetBlue’s data showing that the company experienced a 3% increase and a 2% increase in retention and engagement, respectively, for every 10% increase in employees reporting being recognized. And it’s not just that recognition positively influences retention; a lack of recognition negatively affects retention. The Gallup research found that employees who only received recognition from their peers a few times a year are 39% more likely to say they don’t plan on being at the same organization in one year. Types of Peer Recognition Programs Recognition programs come in a variety of different forms. As you develop or refine the recognition program at your organization, consider incorporating the following popular strategies. Nominations: Including employee nominations as part of a recognition program is a great way to tie employee appreciation to behaviors that correlate to your company values. For example, a company that has a value of “Put customers first” might have nominations for Most Creative Customer Problem-Solver or Friendliest Customer Service Agent. Nomination programs are flexible, and can easily be adjusted to accommodate budget, or to focus on the team rather than the individual. Praise: Use a tool like Lattice to give praise to coworkers for a job well done. Lattice Praise integrates directly with Slack, so you can celebrate successes and share employee appreciation for everyone to see. And Lattice Praise makes it easy to share casual, impromptu peer recognition, and can help bolster a culture of feedback. Rewards or Points Programs: Rewards or points programs allow employees to earn points from the recognition they receive. Over time, they can redeem points for a gift card or other selection of their choice. Companies that opt for points programs often use a third-party platform to facilitate the process, like WeGift or eGifter Rewards. Promoting Peer Recognition Positive recognition is contagious. The more praise and recognition you have in the workplace, the more you encourage a culture of recognition. But this has to start somewhere, and that somewhere should be with leaders. “Managers have to model giving praise for the peers to see,” said Goodson. One of the ways she has worked to model praise with her teams is through a “shout-out” ritual at the beginning of meetings. “I would start and shout-out someone on the team, then maybe the recruiter would jump in and give a shout out to the People ops person, and so on,” she said. “Leaders have to ask themselves, ‘If [we] want to build a culture of praise, how do [we] model that?’” Additionally, it helps to select a peer recognition program that naturally encourages engagement. For example, JetBlue’s peer recognition program allows employees to cash out their points for rewards, which contributes to high employee engagement as the employees are active participants in the program. Lastly, offer more than one form of peer recognition program at your company. You could keep physical thank you cards around the office, while using a technology platform that allows employees to give praise to one another, and holding quarterly awards ceremonies where peers can nominate one another for various accolades. Just as employees have preferences when it comes to receiving praise, some may have preferences for giving it as well — so offering several different options means your organization will be more likely to meet the preferences and needs of all your employees. — Recognition may seem like a small gesture but it holds enormous power to positively influence workplaces — and this effect is only magnified when peers contribute to positively acknowledging their colleagues. The praise we receive from managers and leaders is powerful, important, and affirming, but praise from our peers can carry more personal significance. Promoting peer recognition in the workplace doesn’t have to be complicated. Managers can start by modeling the behavior for their staff members and making recognition and praise a part of team rituals and meetings. Technology can be useful, too. Lattice Praise makes it easy to celebrate colleagues’ wins and share appreciative feedback directly in Slack. The ultimate goal is simple but impactful: Express gratitude and encourage appreciation for excellent work, and employees will do the same.'}, {'title': 'Building Fair and Equitable Employee Compensation with GoodUnited', 'description': \"Charleston-based GoodUnited offers social media fundraising tools that help nonprofits raise money on social media. While the company is very customer-driven, doing everything in its power to help nonprofits connect with donors and raise the awareness and funds they need to further their causes, GoodUnited also knows the importance of investing in its own employees, too. In fact, one of the business’ values is, “Fiercely take care of each other and our families.” That’s why it’s no surprise that the business hired William “Bill” Haig to be the company’s Vice President of Operations. Upon starting his new role at GoodUnited, Bill got right to work expanding his team and building out new People processes. “My team’s role is to make sure that GoodUnited remains one of the best places to work so that our people can go out and help our nonprofit clients accomplish their missions and change the world for the better,” explains Bill. But, the company’s size quickly outpaced the scale of its people management practices when it jumped from 30 employees to 55 in just a year. “At the time, we were decent at OKRs and we were attempting, but not excelling at, having regular 1:1s. We didn’t have the right channels for open feedback, engagement and pulse surveys, or 360-degree reviews,” says Bill. “A lot of these factors were manager dependent because we didn’t have a documented system or processes in place.” To help, Bill and his team started brainstorming ways to add more structure and scalability to the company’s People processes. They decided they needed a new HR software platform that could help the company build a culture of ongoing feedback while embracing continuous performance management. Per a colleague’s recommendation, Bill found Lattice and was immediately wowed by its employee 1:1s tool and 360-degree review features. “Lattice was just so dead-on to what we were looking for that it felt like we built it ourselves,” admits Bill. “We tore through the People Strategy book written by one of Lattice’s Founders and we were sold.” One of the leading reasons they chose Lattice? “We got the sense Lattice would grow with us and was committed to our future,” says Bill. “We haven’t been disappointed. Lattice continues to add features that are exactly what we need.” So, when Lattice unveiled Lattice Compensation, Bill and his team knew it was just the tool they needed in their HR tech stack. Just a few months before, Bill and his team ran their first compensation review for the company’s 50+ employees — manually. “We didn't realize what an animal compensation was until we really dove into it. It was organized chaos,” Bill says. “We manually updated compensation information for 50 employees. We had to verify that compensation and performance information was up to date while ensuring the wrong sheet or email wasn’t shared with the wrong person.” Aside from ensuring the process was private and secure, Bill also had to triple-check the accuracy of all employee information in 50 separate Google Sheets and ensure all pay adjustments were fair.\\u200b “When you’re dealing with someone's pay, messing up a number here or a digit there can be catastrophic — and that's on top of the already complex piece of making sure someone had a fair review, determining their compensation increase, and making sure it correlates with performance,” he says. While the People Ops team successfully completed the review, they knew running it manually again was out of the question — both for their sanity and the fact that it would be impractical as the company continues to grow. Not to mention, the review took up so much of the team’s time that they didn’t have the opportunity to explain the rationale behind compensation increases and give employees the transparency and clarity around the pay they deserved. Since GoodUnited was already using Lattice for engagement surveys, career growth, people analytics, and performance reviews, it only made sense to add Lattice Compensation into the mix as well. “Basically, we knew where we wanted our People processes to be, but we didn’t fully know how to get there, states Bill. “That is until we found Lattice.” Using Lattice at GoodUnited When Bill and his team started implementing Lattice, GoodUnited’s next performance review was only a few months away — far too soon to onboard a new platform, train employees on how to use it, and successfully administer both performance and compensation reviews. But the Lattice team assured him it was more than possible. The thought of never having to manually run a compensation review again was too enticing for Bill and his team, who took Lattice up on the challenge. “It was two and a half months from signing the contract to running a full 360-degree and compensation review. It's something that was very well received by our organization and that our team was proud to put our name on. Had you told me in November that we were going to complete a full 360-degree review with almost no hiccups by February, I would've told you ‘there's no way,’” exclaims Bill. While Bill was worried about whether employees would take to the new system, he had nothing to fear. Lattice’s team and its robust resource library gave him all the support he needed to train employees on the platform and win their buy-in ahead of reviews. “The biggest thing for us was getting our team members bought-in and trained. Lattice was phenomenal with this,” says Bill. “First and foremost, its prebuilt decks designed for every stakeholder made it easy to brief our employees. Plus, the Lattice team was so willing to hop on any calls and demos we hosted to get our organization trained up.” The quick onboarding and employee training paid off, since GoodUnited employees loved how easy the Lattice platform is to use. Aside from usability, Bill says the platform’s biggest benefit is its ability to bring together all of their People data in one place and help prioritize continuous performance management for the entire company. “Lattice connects all our feedback, 360-degree reviews, and one-on-one data so our people can see the big picture of their overall performance — like how they're being measured and how it ties back to their compensation,” shares Bill. “The benefits of this functionality are for our employees first and foremost, not the organization, which isn’t always the case with HR software.” To further benefit employees, the company also rolled out Lattice Grow to help add transparency and clarity around career and growth opportunities within the organization — an addition that was highly sought after by employees. “We didn’t have anything in place before Grow, which was one of the biggest pain points of our team members. We had high performers who didn’t know where they were going in the organization, how to get there, or even how they were being evaluated,” says Bill. “Team members had to take the company's word that as they grew roles would be created or opened up within the organization. It made it hard for team members to visualize how to grow within the company.” While Bill and his team are still building out competencies and career tracks within the tool, they’re aiming to launch a full rollout in just a few months. This tool, alongside Lattice 1:1s, Feedback, Reviews, Compensation, and Goals, will ensure every GoodUnited employee has the resources they need to take ownership of their careers and prioritize their professional growth. Impact of Lattice Thanks to Lattice, GoodUnited employees now have a holistic view of not only their individual performance, but also the career opportunities available to them within the organization. “Lattice has done a phenomenal job of helping us create clarity and transparency in team members' lives. Our employees now have a way to see where they stand and how they can grow within the organization,” says Bill. “They also have multiple channels they can use to give feedback to other team members and the organization as a whole, so we can all continue to get better together,” he adds. While Lattice has clearly made an impact on GoodUnited employees, Bill and his team have also benefited immensely from the platform. To start, they love that all of their People tools live in one place. “Each Lattice tool is capable of being its own standalone product, so you're not sacrificing quality to consolidate. Instead, you’re taking the best solutions possible and bringing them together in one place. That’s been a home run for us,” shares Bill. “We're not having people bounce from solution to solution and asking them to retrain and learn new processes. It all just lives in Lattice.” The beauty of a people success platform means all of their People data lives in one place too. “We love the data Lattice gives us. It helps our team really show the value of some of these solutions,” says Bill. “Plus, it allows us to tie things like employee Net Promoter Score, sentiment, or survey results back to specific employee characteristics, like compensation and tenure. That helps us find unique insights we can use to make the organization better. That was just too powerful of a resource to pass up,” he adds. Plus, Bill and his team have been able to save their time and sanity by putting manual compensation review processes on autopilot. With Lattice Compensation, the team has been able to ditch Google Sheets and seamlessly incorporate performance data in their compensation review process. “Lattice’s Compensation tool just aligns with so much of what we are doing and where we want to go. It takes everything we were doing in spreadsheets across multiple platforms and consolidates it to one easy-to-use location,” Bill shares. “It also creates more clarity and transparency around the process for our employees and managers, helping my team tell a cleaner story by linking aspects of compensation back to performance.” Plus, the tool has helped the company get closer to achieving its goal of fair and transparent compensation increases. “This last performance cycle, Lattice Compensation helped us award pay adjustments in a fair way to make sure that someone was getting the increase or movement that they deserved. That was really, really hard to do when we were running reviews manually. It’s helped us make those big changes and recommendations in a fair, easier, more reliable, and consistent way,” says Bill. Lattice hasn’t only helped Bill automate compensation reviews, but it’s also helped him scale programs and processes at a rate he previously thought was impossible with only three People professionals on his team. When Bill tells other industry professionals about the work they’ve done, he’s often met with disbelief. “I have a business coach who has 35+ years of HR experience at a major corporation and some of the things we roll out she just cannot believe,” shares Bill. “She says things like ‘Bill that would take a large team an entire year to roll out!’ While I’ll just respond ‘We’ve got Lattice.’ It's a massive force multiplier for us.” But the Lattice platform can’t take all the credit. Lattice’s team have immensely helped the GoodUnited team setup, manage, and scale their People processes from day one. Bill says he’s been blown away with how friendly and helpful the entire Lattice staff are. “Every single person we've worked with from Lattice has been phenomenal. Throughout the sales and onboarding processes to now working with our customer success manager, it literally felt like we've got people who care just as much about our team members as we do. It's honestly like having an additional person on our team who 100% has our back,” he says. Still, Bill shares Lattice’s biggest win has been allowing his team to measure and quantify the impact of their new programs and policies. “People operations can often be a very hard-to-measure concept,” Bill admits. “With the Lattice Analytics, we can not only put measurable business metrics around the changes we’re making, but we can also ensure every voice is being heard — not just the extroverts or the loudest people in the room.” He adds, “Together, all of the Lattice tools create a world-class solution for helping us to keep our culture a competitive advantage.” ||||I|||| Introducing Lattice Payroll | Learn more Platform ⯆ Performance Compensation Analytics OKRs & Goals Grow Engagement HRIS Payroll coming soon Featured Lattice AI Learn about the AI-enhancements coming to Lattice's Talent Suite Lattice Product Updates Explore what's coming on our roadmap, and product updates.

We had high performers who didn’t know where they were going in the organization, how to get there, or even how they were being evaluated,” says Bill. “Team members had to take the company's word that as they grew roles would be created or opened up within the organization. It made it hard for team members to visualize how to grow within the company.” While Bill and his team are still building out competencies and career tracks within the tool, they’re aiming to launch a full rollout in just a few months. This tool, alongside Lattice 1:1s, Feedback, Reviews, Compensation, and Goals, will ensure every GoodUnited employee has the resources they need to take ownership of their careers and prioritize their professional growth. Impact of Lattice Thanks to Lattice, GoodUnited employees now have a holistic view of not only their individual performance, but also the career opportunities available to them within the organization. “Lattice has done a phenomenal job of helping us create clarity and transparency in team members' lives. Our employees now have a way to see where they stand and how they can grow within the organization,” says Bill. “They also have multiple channels they can use to give feedback to other team members and the organization as a whole, so we can all continue to get better together,” he adds. While Lattice has clearly made an impact on GoodUnited employees, Bill and his team have also benefited immensely from the platform. To start, they love that all of their People tools live in one place. “Each Lattice tool is capable of being its own standalone product, so you're not sacrificing quality to consolidate. Instead, you’re taking the best solutions possible and bringing them together in one place. That’s been a home run for us,” shares Bill. “We're not having people bounce from solution to solution and asking them to retrain and learn new processes. It all just lives in Lattice.” The beauty of a people success platform means all of their People data lives in one place too. “We love the data Lattice gives us. It helps our team really show the value of some of these solutions,” says Bill. “Plus, it allows us to tie things like employee Net Promoter Score, sentiment, or survey results back to specific employee characteristics, like compensation and tenure. That helps us find unique insights we can use to make the organization better. That was just too powerful of a resource to pass up,” he adds. Plus, Bill and his team have been able to save their time and sanity by putting manual compensation review processes on autopilot. With Lattice Compensation, the team has been able to ditch Google Sheets and seamlessly incorporate performance data in their compensation review process. “Lattice’s Compensation tool just aligns with so much of what we are doing and where we want to go. It takes everything we were doing in spreadsheets across multiple platforms and consolidates it to one easy-to-use location,” Bill shares. “It also creates more clarity and transparency around the process for our employees and managers, helping my team tell a cleaner story by linking aspects of compensation back to performance.” Plus, the tool has helped the company get closer to achieving its goal of fair and transparent compensation increases. “This last performance cycle, Lattice Compensation helped us award pay adjustments in a fair way to make sure that someone was getting the increase or movement that they deserved. That was really, really hard to do when we were running reviews manually. It’s helped us make those big changes and recommendations in a fair, easier, more reliable, and consistent way,” says Bill. Lattice hasn’t only helped Bill automate compensation reviews, but it’s also helped him scale programs and processes at a rate he previously thought was impossible with only three People professionals on his team. When Bill tells other industry professionals about the work they’ve done, he’s often met with disbelief. “I have a business coach who has 35+ years of HR experience at a major corporation and some of the things we roll out she just cannot believe,” shares Bill. “She says things like ‘Bill that would take a large team an entire year to roll out!’ While I’ll just respond ‘We’ve got Lattice.’ It's a massive force multiplier for us.” But the Lattice platform can’t take all the credit. Lattice’s team have immensely helped the GoodUnited team setup, manage, and scale their People processes from day one. Bill says he’s been blown away with how friendly and helpful the entire Lattice staff are. “Every single person we've worked with from Lattice has been phenomenal. Throughout the sales and onboarding processes to now working with our customer success manager, it literally felt like we've got people who care just as much about our team members as we do. It's honestly like having an additional person on our team who 100% has our back,” he says. Still, Bill shares Lattice’s biggest win has been allowing his team to measure and quantify the impact of their new programs and policies. “People operations can often be a very hard-to-measure concept,” Bill admits. “With the Lattice Analytics, we can not only put measurable business metrics around the changes we’re making, but we can also ensure every voice is being heard — not just the extroverts or the loudest people in the room.” He adds, “Together, all of the Lattice tools create a world-class solution for helping us to keep our culture a competitive advantage.” Takeaways * Lattice has been a “force multiplier” for the GoodUnited team, allowing them to scale their People programs and achieve more than they thought possible with a three-person team. * Lattice Compensation has allowed the GoodUnited team to tie compensation to performance and improve transparency and clarity around pay increases. * Lattice has given GoodUnited’s employees greater visibility into their individual performance and growth opportunities within the organization. * With the company’s People data in one central spot, the People Ops team can measure the impact of their initiatives and take action to ensure the company remains a great place to work. * Lattice had GoodUnited running their first review cycle within the platform after only three weeks.
